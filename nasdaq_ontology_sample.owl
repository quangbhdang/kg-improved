    <nas:hasContent>Wednesday, Dec 6, saw U.S. airline stocks perform exceedingly well on the bourses. Shares of industrial heavyweights like Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL gained 3.54%, 2.67% and 3.38%, respectively, on Dec 6 over Dec 5’s closing. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 2.19% at the close of trading on Dec 6.
All of the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
What Led to the Northward Price Movement?
The catalyst behind the impressive performance on the bourses was the bullish commentary of Delta’s management at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer &amp; Retail Conference. After a record-breaking performance during the Thanksgiving holiday period, management expects another rosy performance in terms of traffic during Christmas, thereby ending the year on a strong note.
We remind investors that more than 5.3 million customers availed of DAL flights between Nov 17 and Nov 26. DAL operated more than 43,000 flights systemwide during this period to meet the buoyant air travel demand witnessed during the Thanksgiving holiday period.
At the investor event, management also sounded optimistic about international air travel in 2024 and stated that its performance with respect to Trans-Atlantic travel had been particularly strong in the current year, leading to a significant increase in capacity to meet the buoyant demand scenario. Management expects the strong Trans-Atlantic performance to continue next year, as advanced bookings remain strong and are anticipated to pick up as we approach March.
Highlighting that air travel demand has held up well over the past few weeks, DAL maintained the fourth-quarter and 2023 outlook that it provided in October with its third-quarter results. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be $1.05-$1.30 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.15 per share.
The adjusted operating margin in the December quarter is expected to be 9-11%. Management projects fourth-quarter total revenues (adjusted) to increase 9-12% on a year-over-year basis. DAL continues to anticipate adjusted earnings of $6.00-$6.25 per share for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.10 per share. For 2023, the adjusted operating margin is expected to be 11.5%. Management projects full-year total revenues (adjusted) to increase 20% on a year-over-year basis.
Airlines Regain Mojo Ahead of Year-end 
The record traffic during the Thanksgiving period has provided the much-needed boost to airline stocks after a tough few months due to headwinds like high labor and fuel costs, and a slowdown in domestic air travel demand. We note that airline stocks have been performing well of late and the uptick on Dec 6 was part of that uptrend.
Over the past month, stocks in the Zacks Airline industry have gained 11.5%, handily outperforming the S&amp;P 500’s 3.9% appreciation.

 Similar to DAL, American Airlines and United Airlines have attracted huge traffic in the Thanksgiving travel period. AAL flights attracted 6.5 million customers over the Thanksgiving holiday, thereby establishing a record for the airline, with Nov 26 being its busiest day. UAL flights, too, were packed, with a record 3.2 million passengers flying between Nov 17 and Nov 23.
The upbeat air-traffic scenario apart, the decline in oil price from the 2023 highs reached in late September bodes well for airlines. This is because expenses on fuel represent significant input costs for airlines.

NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected this week to recognize a soon-to-be-updated methodology favored by the ethanol industry in guidance to companies looking to claim tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
For months the administration has been divided over whether to recognize the Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model.
As it stands, that model would enable ethanol-based SAF to qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law.
The news, which was first reported by Reuters, is a win for the ethanol industry and the U.S. Corn Belt, a powerful constituency ahead of the 2024 presidential election.
The group sees SAF as one of the only routes to grow ethanol demand amid rising sales of electric vehicles. Biden, a Democrat, is seeking re-election and will depend on votes from closely contested Midwestern states that are the heaviest corn producers.
The administration, however, is also expected to announce it will update the GREET methodology by March 1, the sources said.
That leaves some uncertainty for corn-based ethanol producers, as the administration is expected to ultimately tighten requirements around SAF feedstocks.
Until the updates are announced, a fierce lobbying push is expected. Ethanol groups have been at odds with environmentalists who want standards that elevate feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fat.
The Treasury Department declined to comment for this story, while the White House did not respond to a request for comment.
SAF producers seeking tax credits under the IRA must demonstrate, with an approved scientific model, that their fuel generates 50% less greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle than petroleum fuel.
The ethanol industry argues the U.S. needs to use ready technology like ethanol to quickly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper called the administration's decision "a pivotal moment for the future of sustainable aviation fuels" earlier this week.
One of environmental groups' central concerns about the use of the GREET model - that it would underestimate the emissions generated by tilling land for crops - appears to be unresolved, said Nikita Pavlenko, fuels team lead at the International Council on Clean Transportation.
The lifecycle emissions calculated by GREET for any given fuel can vary widely depending on what data sources and assumptions are plugged into the model, and any future update on how producers should use the GREET model needs to take a stringent approach, he said.
"Some of the values (for land-use change) favored by industry haven't gone through the regulatory process, and don't line up with the academic consensus," he said.
White House adviser John Podesta said on Thursday the SAF guidance would be released very soon.
"We think, in order to take advantage of the credit, that emissions have to be 50% below what oil-based aviation fuel looks like," Podesta told reporters on Thursday.

    <nas:hasContent>By Jody Godoy and Disha Raychaudhuri
Dec 18 (Reuters) - At least six major U.S. companies including JPMorgan Chase have modified policies meant to boost racial and ethnic representation that conservative groups threatened to sue over, a Reuters review of corporate statements has found.
The companies are among 25 that received public shareholder letters since 2021 claiming their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs constitute illegal discrimination and a breach of the directors' duties to investors.
The changes made by the companies primarily involved removing language that said certain programs were for underrepresented groups or modifying executives' goals for increased racial representation in the workforce.
Reuters could not find any publicly available changes to DEI policies instituted by the other 19 companies, including McDonald’s MCD.N and Starbucks SBUX.O. Several companies received letters after putting out their most recent annual reports, where some of the policies are outlined.
A Starbucks spokesperson said the company was committed to a culture of belonging. McDonald's did not respond to a request for comment.
JPMorgan JPM.N received a letter in May 2022, alleging 10 of its DEI initiatives were discriminatory and unlawful. Around February 2023, the descriptions of the bank's "Advancing Hispanics &amp; Latinos" and "Advancing Black Pathways" programs were changed, according to archived versions of its website.
The programs that were previously for Black and Latino students now invite applications from all students, "regardless of background."
"We remain fully committed to an inclusive workforce made up of top talent," said JPMorgan spokesperson Allison Kahn.
Investment manager BlackRock BLK.N, which received a letter in April, removed language stating a scholarship was "designed for" members of specific underrepresented groups.
Ashley Beale, a BlackRock spokesperson, said the company was proud to expand eligibility for the scholarships.
The companies where Reuters found changes included Pizza Hut operator Yum! Brands YUM.N, American Airlines AAL.O and Lowe's LOW.N, which declined to comment. The changes at BlackRock and Lowe's were previously reported. Lee jeans maker Kontoor Brands KTB.N did not respond. Reuters was unable to directly link the diversity program modifications with the lawsuit threats.
The changes show how some of America's biggest businesses have reacted to a larger conservative backlash against diversity initiatives, which multiplied after widespread protests following the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans in 2020. The protests spotlighted racial and gender disparities in corporate leadership.
The letters have been sent by two conservative legal organizations: the American Civil Rights Project, founded by Texas attorney Dan Morenoff, and America First Legal, led by Stephen Miller, who was an adviser to Republican former President Donald Trump.
"Baby steps toward compliance, toward the fair and equal treatment of all Americans, are certainly welcome," said Morenoff.
"While we welcome authentic moves by corporations to eliminate racial considerations and comply with the law, we condemn inauthentic changes that use code language to achieve the same result," said Gene Hamilton, general counsel at America First Legal.
Abandoning initiatives to cut through unconscious bias that favors white men will, over time, ensure that people from underrepresented communities don't rise to the top of organizations, said David Thomas, president of Morehouse College.
"(Companies) will be ensuring that 30 years from now the corporate landscape of America looks like a plantation," he said.
Attacks on DEI programs will likely continue as the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches. Former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, both current presidential hopefuls, have banned various DEI initiatives.
Groups opposed to diversity policies have also been energized by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that struck down affirmative action in university admissions decisions.
The admissions ruling does not directly affect employers, which have long been subject to anti-discrimination laws that bar using race and gender in individual hiring decisions. DEI programs that expand the pool of applicants and remove barriers to advancement are considered legal.
Atinuke Adediran, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, wrote in a forthcoming paper that in 2023 nearly 40% of the 423 companies she studied had adopted targets for racial representation in reports published before May.
LEGAL RISKS?
The letters allege certain DEI policies expose the companies to legal risks and must be abandoned or the groups will sue to hold the directors liable.
America First Legal sent Kontoor Brands a threat letter in July 2022, taking aim at global DEI goals the company set in 2020, including pay incentives for executives to increase gender and racial representation.
The next year, the incentives were instead tied to improving "inclusion" scores on an employee survey without any mention of gender or racial representation, according to a filing Kontoor made in March 2023.
In their most recent executive compensation plans, Yum! Brands removed references to specific racial groups and American Airlines dropped numerical diversity targets.
American said in a July report that it had largely achieved its prior targets and its new goals focus on DEI training and activities.
Shareholders can sue when directors have failed in their duties, such as oversight, but corporate law protects directors' good-faith decisions from lawsuits, creating a high legal bar for the groups' claims if they ever go to court.
Morenoff and conservative shareholder group National Center for Public Policy Research sued Starbucks' directors in November 2022. They accused them of pushing the company to adopt a DEI program to obtain "social-credit" for themselves.
Chief U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian in Spokane, Washington, dismissed the case in September.
"Courts of law have no business involving themselves with reasonable and legal decisions made by the board of directors," he wrote.
Morenoff said the ruling does not change his view of the law.
Ani Huang, head of the Center On Executive Compensation, said changes like the ones Reuters found were more of a "workaround" to deal with critics than a policy shift, as companies will continue to face calls to improve DEI from shareholders and others.
"In this as in many things, companies are stuck in the middle," she said.

    <nas:hasContent>Gold, a safe-haven investment during a challenging period, has been trending upward encouraging calls for a surge in the commodity’s price to reach its price peak.
The price of the yellow commodity has been ascending amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the increasing probability of the Fed adopting a dovish stance in the coming year. The likelihood of the Fed cutting interest rates in 2024 has resulted in the long-term treasury rates declining, making the commodity more appealing to investors compared to bonds.
Gold Price Projections
According to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, as quoted on Yahoo Finance, driven by factors like falling real rates, rising cycles and the current geopolitical scenario, the precious metal is estimated to hit $2500 per ounce, surging about 22% from its current price levels.
As per Bank of America, as quoted on Kitco, if the Fed opts for an earlier cut, Bank of America strategists anticipate gold reaching $2,400 per ounce by the end of 2024.
Michele Schneider, partner and director of trading education and research at MarketGauge, as stated in the Yahoo Finance article, estimates gold prices to reach $3,000.
Challenging Macro Backdrop Pushes Gold Prices
As per JP Morgan’s global equity strategy team’s new outlook, the broad market index, the S&amp;P 500, is forecast to decline around 8% by the end of 2024, amid heightened geopolitical and political risks, according to Yahoo Finance.
JP Morgan’s bearish outlook was also supported by Morgan Stanley, which forecasts the S&amp;P 500 to fall to 4,500 at the next year-end. However, Morgan Stanley, unlike JP Morgan, was bullish on the corporate earnings front.
The bearish outlook on the index can prompt investors to take shelter in the precious metal to hedge themselves from the downside.
Wealth Protection During Recession Likelihood
In periods of economic uncertainty, like recessions, gold attracts more investors due to its enduring value. Frequently seen as a safe-haven investment, investing in the yellow metal during volatile periods can prove to be beneficial. As returns on bonds, stocks, and property decrease, interest in gold rises, boosting its value.
Economists at Deutsche Bank expect a mild recession in the first half of 2024, stemming from the U.S. economy consecutively contracting in the first two quarters of 2024 and weakening economic indicators. According to EY, the probability of the U.S. economy sliding into a recession in 2024 is around 50%.
Warren Buffett’s increasing cash reserves, standing around $157 billion, indicates that ‘The Oracle of Oklahoma’ is bracing for a projected economic downturn or even a recession (Read: ETFs in Focus as Buffett's Cash Surge Indicates a Likely Recession).
Value of Greenback Further Helps Gold Prices
Gold prices are inversely related to the value of the U.S. dollar as gold is priced in dollars. A weaker U.S. dollar generally leads to higher demand for gold, pushing its price upward, as it becomes more affordable for buyers holding other currencies.
The increasing probability of the Fed embracing a dovish approach and cutting its interest rates in 2024, has resulted in a weakening U.S. dollar. According to Trading View, U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen about 2.74% over the past month and around 1.46% over the past year.
ETFs in Focus
Investors wanting to hedge themselves against an economic slump, the likelihood of a recession and falling greenback can increase their portfolio exposures in Gold ETFs. Across extended investment periods, gold preserves its purchasing power, outpacing inflation and contributing significant diversification to an investment portfolio due to its historical tendency to have a negative correlation with other asset classes.

TAIPEI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - TSMC 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, said on Tuesday that its board had recommended that current CEO and Vice Chairman C.C. Wei succeed Mark Liu who will be retiring next year as chairman.
Company veteran Liu became Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's TSM.N chairman in 2018 after founder Morris Chang, who remains the senior statesman of Taiwan's chip industry, retired.
Liu, who joined TSMC in 1993, said he would like to put his "decades of semiconductor experience to other use, spend more time with my family, and start the next chapter of my life", according to a company statement.
"I am confident that TSMC will continue to perform outstandingly in the years to come."
The TSMC board's Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee recommended that Wei succeed Liu, subject to the election of the incoming board in June 2024.
Wei, who has a doctorate in electrical engineering from Yale University, has been on the company's board since 2017 and joined TSMC in 1998.
TSMC is a major supplier to companies like Apple and Nvidia.

    <nas:hasContent>BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A lawyer for JetBlue Airways JBLU.O on Tuesday urged a federal judge to allow it to proceed with its planned $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit AirlinesSAVE.N and reject the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) bid to block the deal.
JetBlue attorney Ryan Shores at the end of a closely watched trial in federal court in Boston argued that the proposed merger was pro-consumer and key to creating a "viable, disruptive national challenge to the industry’s dominant airlines.”
The DOJ has sought to block the merger, arguing that it would diminish competition by removing ultra-low-cost, no-frills Spirit from a market where it has acted as a disruptor, thereby causing fares to increase and flights to decrease.
But Shores said that unlike the largest airlines that are flourishing in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, lower-cost companies like JetBlue and Spirit have faced significant financial headwinds that would stifle their ability to meaningfully challenge the biggest airlines on their own.
"Future growth for the smaller, disruptive airlines is not possible without profit," he told U.S. District Judge William Young in his closing argument. "Meanwhile, the legacy airlines will continue to pull away."
The DOJ, along with Democratic state attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia, sued in March to block the merger, which would combine the sixth- and seventh-largest U.S. airlines.
JetBlue has sought to ease U.S. regulators' antitrust concerns by agreeing to sell off Spirit's gates and slots at certain airports in New York City, Boston, Newark and Fort Lauderdale.
But the DOJ has said that those divestitures are not enough, and that if JetBlue takes over Spirit, passengers would suffer roughly $1 billion in net harm annually as fares increase and flight options decrease.
Young at a hearing in March said he felt an "obligation" to try to rule by year's end.

    <nas:hasContent>In the past week, Southwest Airlines’ LUV management increased its fourth-quarter 2023 guidance for fuel cost per gallon. The Dallas-based carrier reduced its growth target for capacity (measured in annual seat miles) beyond 2024. LUV was also in the news when its flight attendants voted down a tentative pay-related deal.
Copa Holdings CPA reported solid traffic numbers for November on the back of upbeat air-travel demand. Another Latin American carrier, Azul’s AZUL November traffic was impressive on an upbeat air-travel demand.
Read the last Airline Roundup here.
Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories
1. Southwest Airlines’ management expects fourth-quarter 2023 available seat miles to improve 21% from the year-ago reported figure. Economic fuel costs per gallon are expected to be $3-$3.1 (earlier expectation: $2.90-$3). LUV expects cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to decrease 16-19% in the fourth quarter from the comparable period in 2022. Interest expenses are anticipated to be $65 million in the fourth quarter. LUV narrowed its anticipated revenue per available seat mile to a 9-10% decline from a 9-11% dip expected earlier.
LUV expects first-quarter 2024 capacity to increase 10-12%from first-quarter 2023 actuals. The 2024 capacity is likely to increase 6-8% from the 2023 actual. Management expects capacity beyond 2024 to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range (in percentage terms), down from the earlier stated mid-single-digit rise. The airline anticipates year-over-year trip growth beyond 2024 to be in the low-single digits.
In another development, 64% of LUV’s flight attendants voted against the proposed five-year deal pertaining to pay hikes and better working conditions. Apart from pay raises, the provisional agreement also had provisions pertaining to paid parental and maternity leave with insurance coverage. The Dallas-based carrier’s flight attendants are represented by the Transport Workers Union Local 556.
2. Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) increased 12.4% at Copa Holdings in November on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In November, available seat miles increased 11.9% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 87.4% from 87.1% in November 2022. Currently, CPA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
3. In November, AZUL’s consolidated revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 8.2% and 8.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) came in at 79.2% in November 2023. On the domestic front, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 1.7% and 3.3%, year over year, respectively.
4. American Airlines AAL has been added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. This is the first time that AAL has become part of this prestigious index. For the third consecutive year, AAL is part of the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. The Dow Jones Sustainability World Index comprises global sustainability leaders as identified by S&amp;P Global through the Corporate Sustainability Assessment. The index represents the top 10% of the largest 2,500 companies in the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index, based on long-term economic, environmental and social criteria.

    <nas:hasContent>By Andy Home
LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Funds have been reducing their bets on lower copper prices as macroeconomic headwinds abate and the market collectively reassesses copper's supply dynamics.
Money managers are now marginally net long of copper on both the London Metal Exchange (LME) and CME contracts.
The shift in positioning has been playing out since the end of October, when LME three-month copper CMCU3 was threatening to break down through key technical support at May lows between $7,867 and $7,871 per metric ton.
The anticipated collapse never happened and London copper has since recovered to $8,530.
The price rebound has triggered a change of stance among short-term momentum funds. But the effect has been amplified by expectations that the U.S. rate tightening cycle has passed its peak and by signs that copper supply is not as robust as previously thought.
BEARS BEAT A RETREAT
Fund managers were collectively net short of CME copper to the tune of 21,553 contracts at the end of October, when the price looked likely to break out of its 2023 range on the downside.
They have since shifted to a collective net long of 6,866 contracts, according to the most recent Commitments of Traders Report.
The turnaround reflects a sharp reduction in outright short positions from 76,717 contracts to 46,558 contracts while outright long positions are little changed.
Investor positioning in London has closely mirrored that on the other side of the Atlantic.
Investment funds have collectively flipped from a net LME short position of 15,116 contracts in October to a net long position of 15,046 contracts, with bear bets falling from 47,714 contracts to 25,674.
As with the CME copper contract, there is little enthusiasm for going outright long, particularly among the heavier-weight investment players captured in the LME's "other financial" category, but the collective short play is over for now.
RETHINKING SUPPLY
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said that the US central bank was likely to be done with raising interest rates, which has lifted some of the pressure weighing on copper in recent months.
That change in macro mood music has coincided with a string of bullish developments within copper's micro dynamics.
Copper supply, once again, is turning out to be a lot less resilient than expected.
Although most analysts are almost universally bullish on copper's medium-term prospects thanks to the metal's core role in the energy transition story, the shorter-term outlook was significantly different owing to an expected surge in mine supply this year and next.
However, the prospect of near-term surplus is fading fast.
The first warning sign was the low treatment charges negotiated between Chinese smelters and miners for next year's deliveries.
Chinese smelters were hoping at the very least to roll over this year's terms of $88 a ton and 8.8 cents per pound for converting concentrates to refined metal, but they have accepted a reduction to $80 and 8.0 cents respectively for 2024.
The first such drop in three years signalled a mutual admission that the raw materials market wasn't going to be as well supplied as expected.
CLOSURE AND DOWNGRADES
It seems to have been a good call. Within days of the benchmark smelter terms being agreed, one major mine has been forced to close while two big producers have downgraded their production guidance.
The Panama government ordered the closure of First Quantum's FM.TO Cobre Panama mine this month after the country's top court ruled that the company's mining licence was unconstitutional.
The mine entered production in 2019 and generated 350,000 tons of contained copper last year, meaning its loss is a big hit to global supply.
Both Anglo American AAL.L and Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA, meanwhile, have lowered production guidance for 2024 and 2025.
Anglo has reduced its guidance by 180,000-210,000 tons next year and by 150,000-180,000 tons in 2025, citing geological problems at its Quellaveco mine in Peru and a planned temporary closure of a processing plant at Los Bronces in Chile.
Vale's updated guidance was less dramatic but sufficient for analysts at Macquarie Bank to take a cumulative 100,000 tons off their mine supply forecasts through 2026.
They are not alone in going back to their supply calculations.
A pretty hard consensus that copper was heading for a period of supply-demand surplus both in 2024 and in 2025 is rapidly unravelling.
The newly emerging consensus is that the concentrates market will at best be balanced and possibly in deficit next year with flow-through implications for the refined market.
Investors are not yet persuaded to go long on copper. LME spreads, currently in wide contango, suggest there is no immediate shortage of copper.
But copper's shifting statistical landscape has persuaded many financial players there's little point in expecting copper to break lower any time soon.

    <nas:hasLsaSummary>BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A lawyer for JetBlue Airways JBLU.O on Tuesday urged a federal judge to allow it to proceed with its planned $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit AirlinesSAVE.N and reject the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) bid to block the deal. JetBlue has sought to ease U.S. regulators' antitrust concerns by agreeing to sell off Spirit's gates and slots at certain airports in New York City, Boston, Newark and Fort Lauderdale. But the DOJ has said that those divestitures are not enough, and that if JetBlue takes over Spirit, passengers would suffer roughly $1 billion in net harm annually as fares increase and flight options decrease.</nas:hasLsaSummary>
    <nas:hasLuhnSummary>JetBlue attorney Ryan Shores at the end of a closely watched trial in federal court in Boston argued that the proposed merger was pro-consumer and key to creating a "viable, disruptive national challenge to the industry’s dominant airlines.” The DOJ has sought to block the merger, arguing that it would diminish competition by removing ultra-low-cost, no-frills Spirit from a market where it has acted as a disruptor, thereby causing fares to increase and flights to decrease.

LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Global miner Anglo American AAL.L said on Friday it aimed to reduce capital expenditure by $1.8 billion across its businesses by 2026, as it deepens spending cuts across all its units.
"In the near term, given continuing elevated macro volatility, we are being deliberate in reducing our costs and prioritising our capital to drive more profitable production on a sustainable basis," said Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad in a statement.
The London-listed miner, which had already targeted saving $500 million by cutting corporate jobs and some costs at head offices in Johannesburg, London and other locations, is aiming to cut an additional $500 million by 2024.
It will now reduce production at its South African unit Kumba Iron Ore KIOJ.J, where stockpiles had grown to 9 million tons by September on worsening rail bottlenecks, and focus on higher-margin production for its platinum group metals (PGMs) operations.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday that Anglo was preparing sweeping cost cuts.

    <nas:hasLsaSummary>"It is currently unclear what exactly will be involved at each stage, so we will seek further clarification before being able to consider impacts," De Beers, a unit of Anglo American AAL.L, said. The implementation will depend heavily on India, which wants to minimise potential disruptions for small diamond firms employing millions of people. "We are not happy with the announced timeline for implementation of restrictions," said Vipul Shah, chairman of the Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), a leading Indian trade body.</nas:hasLsaSummary>

"If the intent is to apply a purely technological certification system and to channel all rough imports to the G7 through Belgium, this will be to the detriment of responsible African producers, to all those who depend on the artisanal mining sector, and to the wider industry," De Beers added.</nas:hasLuhnSummary>

    <nas:hasContent>American Airlines (AAL) closed at $13.72 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.29% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.39% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.43%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.2%.
The world's largest airline's stock has climbed by 16.61% in the past month, exceeding the Transportation sector's gain of 7.8% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.28%.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.39 per share and revenue of $52.76 billion, which would represent changes of +378% and +7.73%, respectively, from the prior year.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for American Airlines. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.
Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, American Airlines boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

The Transportation - Airline industry is part of the Transportation sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 191, putting it in the bottom 25% of all 250+ industries.

    <nas:hasContent>In recent trading, shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc (Symbol: AAP) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $58.76, changing hands for $60.83/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 17 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Advance Auto Parts Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $43.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $75.00. The standard deviation is $9.47.
But the whole reason to look at the average AAP price target in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AAP crossing above that average target price of $58.76/share, investors in AAP have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $58.76 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Advance Auto Parts Inc:

    <nas:hasContent>NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 243% year-to-date surge in its stock price, pushing the company to the forefront of technology and innovation. NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in May 2023 by joining the exclusive club of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization.
The surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions.
However, the looming question remains — Can NVIDIA sustain this momentum through 2024?
NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus
NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote
Will GenAI Investments Aid NVDA’s Surge?
NVIDIA’s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. Given generative AI’s inherited opportunities and the company’s leadership in the space, we believe the NVDA stock is poised to carry the momentum in 2024.
NVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy &amp; utilities and video game development.
The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $109.37 billion by 2030, according to a new report by Grand View Research. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 35.6% from 2023 to 2030.
However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.
NVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.
The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Additionally, NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.
Other Stocks in the $1T Club
Apart from NVIDIA, only four companies — Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN — have a market cap of more than $1 trillion at present. AAPL has the highest market cap of $3.05 trillion, followed by MSFT’s $2.77 trillion, GOOGL’s $1.71 trillion and AMZN’s $1.59 trillion. At yesterday’s closing price of $500.77, NVDA has a market capitalization of $1.23 trillion, positioning it in the fifth spot.
Shares of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have rallied 50.7%, 55.4%, 53.9% and 83.2%, respectively, year to date. Currently, AMZN sports a Zacks Rank #1, while AAPL, MSFT and GOOGL each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Zacks Reveals ChatGPT "Sleeper" Stock
One little-known company is at the heart of an especially brilliant Artificial Intelligence sector. By 2030, the AI industry is predicted to have an internet and iPhone-scale economic impact of $15.7 Trillion.

    <nas:hasContent>After an absolute disaster of a year in 2022, the stock market appears to have turned the corner. Each of the major market indexes has gained more than 20% from their respective trough. Perhaps more importantly, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are within striking distance of new highs, which will check the final box marking the start of a new bull market.
Closing out the old and ringing in the new is a great time for examination, and one of the places I start is with my portfolio. A review of my top investments and how they came to be that way can offer valuable insight for the future.
Here's a look at my six largest holdings heading into 2024 (as of the market close on Dec. 15) and the incredibly valuable lesson I learned from each one.

No. 6: Nvidia
Every investor has one -- the "stock that got away." The one you meant to buy, only to find that it got away from you and has risen 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. In my case, that stock was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). I had owned a few shares of the graphics processing units (GPU) pioneer in the early days of my investing journey but ultimately sold them in an unprovoked bid of tax-loss harvesting in early 2010.
I always meant to buy it back, but the stock price meandered for much of the next five years, and I ultimately lost confidence. Things changed quickly in 2016 when the stock tripled. After that, it just kept getting away from me.
Fast forward to early 2018. Nvidia still dominated the discrete desktop GPU space, controlling roughly 70% of the market. The company's graphics cards were the processor of choice for cryptocurrency mining, which was booming. Furthermore, there was an ongoing push toward autonomous driving. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for skating to where the puck was going -- recognizing technology trends on the fly and adapting Nvidia's processors and the accompanying software to meet that need.
After much deliberation, I held my nose and bought Nvidia anyway -- even though the stock had risen 600% over the preceding two years. I have added to my stake several times since. Over the past few years, Nvidia has once again adapted to meet a compelling technology need, becoming the gold standard for generative AI applications.
Since that initial purchase, Nvidia has soared 768%, and the stock has become my sixth-largest holding, amounting to nearly 6% of my portfolio. The lesson here? It's never too late to buy a quality company, even if the stock has already risen many times over.
No. 5 and 4: Shopify and Amazon
Long after Amazon had established itself as the world's largest digital retailer, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) came on the scene with a different approach to e-commerce. Shopify's founders, having discovered firsthand the difficulties inherent in starting an online sales platform, pivoted the business from selling snowboards to providing customizable templates and other tools that made setting up and running an e-commerce business a snap.
By solving a common problem among digital retailers, Shopify carved out a profitable niche for itself in a market that was already (and still is) dominated by Amazon. While it isn't an exact apples-to-apples comparison, it helps illustrate an age-old truth in investing that I learned from owning this stock -- there's a Pepsi for every Coke.
There's another lesson here. I had long been a shareholder of Amazon, but I recognized the value Shopify could bring to the online sales space. Despite the fact that e-commerce was already well represented in my portfolio, I made a sizable investment in Shopify.
That decision turned out well, as both companies have continued to prosper in the age of digital retail. It also turned out well for me as an investor. Since my first purchase of Shopify shares, the stock is up more than 1,446%, while Amazon has gained 844%. Shopify and Amazon are my fourth and fifth largest holdings heading into 2024, each representing roughly 6% of my portfolio.
No. 3: Apple
There's little question that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most successful companies in history. Yet, at times over the past few years, some investors concluded the company had reached its zenith. Apple reached a market cap of $1 trillion in 2018, so how much higher could it go?
There were other worries. As penetration has risen, global smartphone sales have slowed. Since Apple's flagship product -- the iPhone -- historically generates more than half the company's revenue, investor reservations are understandable.
Despite these challenges, Apple has continued to grow. CEO Tim Cook has succeeded in expanding Apple's services business to become the company's second-biggest breadwinner, behind just the iPhone. The segment brought in $85 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), making it comparable to a top 50 company in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, the iPhone continues to dominate where it matters, capturing a record 45% of worldwide smartphone revenue and 85% of profits in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research.
Fears that Apple simply couldn't go any higher turned out to be unfounded, an important lesson for investors as its market cap has tripled since 2018. Since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged more than 3,400% to become my third-largest position at 8% of my portfolio. I'm confident there's more to come.
No. 2: Mercadolibre
It's likely that many investors have never heard of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). The company, which began as a local online auction site, has evolved into the largest e-commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, serving 18 countries in the region.
MercadoLibre not only provides a marketplace for buyers and sellers but also handles shipping and logistics, warehouse and cross-docking, digital payments, consumer and merchant financing, digital wallets, and more. Think of it as the Amazon, Shopify, and PayPal of Latin America all rolled into one.
Many investors have avoided the stock because of the risks inherent in the region, which is understandable. For example, Argentina -- MercadoLibre's birthplace and one of its biggest markets -- has an inflation rate that clocks in at 143%, and the country just devalued its currency by 50%. Other countries in the region grapple with hyperinflation, economic turmoil, charges of political corruption, poor infrastructure, and more.
Yet those risks pale in the context of the opportunity. Latin America is years behind the U.S. in terms of e-commerce and digital payment penetration, yet adoption continues to grow. Furthermore, Latin America has twice the population of the U.S. and is the fastest-growing e-commerce market in the world, according to Americas Market Intelligence. Finally, because MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction, it has sidestepped many of those risks. As a result, its revenue grew 50% in 2022 while net income soared 480%, a trend that has been ongoing for more than a decade.
Understanding the risk, viewed through the lens of the significant long-term opportunity, can provide important insight, which gave me the confidence to buy the stock. My rather modest initial investment in MercadoLibre in 2009 has grown by more than 7,300%, and the company now represents 10% of my portfolio. Not bad for a "risky" stock.
No. 1: Netflix
Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought when I started investing in late 2007. After incurring a late fee at Blockbuster (remember them?) that was more than the cost of buying the movie new, I cut up my membership card and subscribed to Netflix. As an extremely satisfied customer, it made perfect sense to buy the stock once I started investing.
Back then, the company was a DVD-by-mail service that had recently begun experimenting with streaming video. Netflix had achieved remarkable penetration in its earliest markets, and I surmised the company could expand its success across the country, which was the basis of my investing thesis.
The company has achieved all that and more, becoming the world's largest subscription streaming video service. The value of the initial shares I bought in 2007 has surged more than 19,000%, making Netflix my largest holding at nearly 11% of my portfolio.
However, those life-changing gains were only possible because I held the stock for the duration, which is easier said than done. Remember the "Qwikster" fiasco of 2011? All the "Netflix killers" over the years? How about the loss of 1.2 million subscribers early last year?
There were plenty of excuses to sell Netflix over the years, but for me, the investing thesis never changed, so I held on. And this long-term buy-and-hold strategy continues to win out.

    <nas:hasContent>For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – December 8, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Griffon GFF as the Bull of the Day and Clearway Energy CWEN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.
Bull of the Day:
Griffon’s stock has offered investors the steady growth and value they look for in the portfolio and lands the Bull of the Day after being added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on Thursday.
The multinational conglomerate and holding company has an expanding presence in the home and building products market along with the consumer and professional products markets.
After hitting 52-week highs of $50 a share this week there could still be plenty of upside for Griffon’s stock with the Average Zacks Price Target of $64.25 a share being 29% above current levels.
Performance Overview
Operating through several subsidiaries including The Ames Companies, Griffon’s stock has popped +39% in 2023 and has now soared over +150% in the last three years to largely outperform the broader indexes.
As one of its most lucrative subsidiaries, The Ames Companies has operations in Massachusetts that date back to 1774 etching its name in American history while becoming a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded tools and products for home storage, organization, and landscaping.
Strengthening Outlook
Extending its impeccable price performance over the last few years was that Griffon was able to beat its fiscal fourth quarter earnings expectations by 22% last month.
Although Griffon’s current fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to dip -7% following a tougher-to-compete-against year, FY25 EPS is projected to rebound and soar 32% to $5.56 per share. More importantly, earnings estimate revisions for both FY24 and FY25 are nicely up over the last 60 days.
This is very compelling considering Griffon’s stock trades at a 12X forward earnings multiple which is a lofty discount to the S&amp;P 500’s 21.2X and its Zacks Diversified Operations Markets' 22.9X with some of the notable names in the space including GM, 3M and Honeywell.
Bottom Line
In addition to sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Griffon’s stock has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for both Value and Growth. Checking many fundamental trading boxes there appears to be more room to run for GFF shares with Griffon offering a respectable 1.21% annual dividend yield as well.
Bear of the Day:
The long-term prospects of alternative energy player Clearway Energy may still be perplexing but unfortunately, there may be more short-term risk ahead landing its stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.
After widely missing earnings expectations for two consecutive quarters investors may want to curb their enthusiasm for Clearway’s luring 6.34% annual dividend yield amid weak renewable resource conditions and lower natural gas prices.
Weak Q3 Results: Notably, the Zacks Alternative Energy-Other Industry is in the bottom 39% of over 250 Zacks industries and Clearway’s Q3 results in November alluded to a tougher operating environment.
While Q3 sales of $371 million topped estimates by 8% earnings of $0.03 a share fell a very concerning -94% below expectations of $0.55 a share. This comes after Q2 earnings of $0.33 a share missed the Zacks Consensus of $0.55 a share by -40% in August.
Weaker Outlook: Largely attributing to Clearway’s strong sell rating, annual earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 are down -10% over the last 60 days while FY24 EPS estimates have fallen -11%.
On top of this, Clearway’s stock is already down -21% this year to vastly underperform the broader indexes and trail its Zacks Subindustry’s -14%.
Takeaway
While it’s far too soon to call Clearway Energy’s stock a value trap, investors may want to think twice before investing in the company at the moment considering its lucrative dividend yield but poor performance of late.

Here's Why Airline Stocks Are Soaring
Wednesday, Dec 6, saw U.S. airline stocks perform exceedingly well on the bourses. Shares of industrial heavyweights like Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines gained 3.54%, 2.67% and 3.38%, respectively, on Dec 6 over Dec 5’s closing. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 2.19% at the close of trading on Dec 6.
All of the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
What Led to the Northward Price Movement?
The catalyst behind the impressive performance on the bourses was the bullish commentary of Delta’s management at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer &amp; Retail Conference. After a record-breaking performance during the Thanksgiving holiday period, management expects another rosy performance in terms of traffic during Christmas, thereby ending the year on a strong note.
We remind investors that more than 5.3 million customers availed of DAL flights between Nov 17 and Nov 26. DAL operated more than 43,000 flights systemwide during this period to meet the buoyant air travel demand witnessed during the Thanksgiving holiday period.
At the investor event, management also sounded optimistic about international air travel in 2024 and stated that its performance with respect to Trans-Atlantic travel had been particularly strong in the current year, leading to a significant increase in capacity to meet the buoyant demand scenario. Management expects the strong Trans-Atlantic performance to continue next year, as advanced bookings remain strong and are anticipated to pick up as we approach March.
Highlighting that air travel demand has held up well over the past few weeks, DAL maintained the fourth-quarter and 2023 outlook that it provided in October with its third-quarter results. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be $1.05-$1.30 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.15 per share.
The adjusted operating margin in the December quarter is expected to be 9-11%. Management projects fourth-quarter total revenues (adjusted) to increase 9-12% on a year-over-year basis. DAL continues to anticipate adjusted earnings of $6.00-$6.25 per share for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.10 per share. For 2023, the adjusted operating margin is expected to be 11.5%. Management projects full-year total revenues (adjusted) to increase 20% on a year-over-year basis.
Airlines Regain Mojo Ahead of Year-End
The record traffic during the Thanksgiving period has provided the much-needed boost to airline stocks after a tough few months due to headwinds like high labor and fuel costs, and a slowdown in domestic air travel demand. We note that airline stocks have been performing well of late and the uptick on Dec 6 was part of that uptrend.
Over the past month, stocks in the Zacks Airline industry have gained 11.5%, handily outperforming the S&amp;P 500’s 3.9% appreciation.
Similar to DAL, American Airlines and United Airlines have attracted huge traffic in the Thanksgiving travel period. AAL flights attracted 6.5 million customers over the Thanksgiving holiday, thereby establishing a record for the airline, with Nov 26 being its busiest day. UAL flights, too, were packed, with a record 3.2 million passengers flying between Nov 17 and Nov 23.
The upbeat air-traffic scenario apart, the decline in oil price from the 2023 highs reached in late September bodes well for airlines. This is because expenses on fuel represent significant input costs for airlines.

Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.

    <nas:hasContent>By Felix Njini and Clara Denina
JOHANNESBURG/LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Anglo American AAL.L is preparing to freeze spending on growth and widen job cuts in South Africa, going far beyond its initial savings target and paving the way to mothballing some higher-cost platinum mines, sources familiar with the matter said.
Anglo's sweeping spending cuts could be announced as soon as Friday, when the miner updates investors on its three-year outlook, five sources said.
The sources said measures include shelving an ambitious plan to boost output at Anglo American Platinum AMSJ.J's key Mogalakwena mine, and, if metals prices remain depressed, place on care and maintenance some shafts at the Amandelbult complex in the longer term, which had been initially targeted for mechanization and output expansion.
A concentrator plant at Amandelbult could also be placed on care and maintenance, one of the sources said.
The moves are likely to result in further job cuts at the operations and lower output guidance, the sources added.
The global miner had initially targeted saving $500 million by cutting corporate jobs and some costs at head offices in Johannesburg, London and other locations.
Scaling down on spending could save an additional $1 billion by end of 2024, with most expected from its platinum operations, one of the sources said, as the company becomes the latest to feel the impact of a price rout ripping through the world's top platinum producer South Africa.
Anglo American declined to comment.
South Africa's platinum mining output has been declining gradually over the past decades as investors balk at investing in new mines amid threats to the metal's future demand from a rapidly growing battery electric vehicle sector.
Platinum, palladium and rhodium are used in devices that curb exhaust emissions from diesel and petrol engines.
A rapid and precipitous plunge in palladium and rhodium has already forced other South African producers including Sibanye Stillwater SSWJ.J and Impala PlatinumIMPJ.J to swiftly move to cut jobs in a bid to preserve margins.
Anglo is also expected to cut jobs and costs at its other South African unit - Kumba Iron Ore KIOJ.J, where stockpiles have grown to 9 million tons by September on worsening rail bottlenecks.
Anglo Platinum is expected by a group of 11 analysts to account for 12% of the group's net earnings at $1.3 billion this year, down from 30% or $4.4 billion in 2022.
The plans come as Anglo Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad seeks to develop a $9 billion Woodsmith fertilizer project in Britain, on which the company announced a $1.7 billion writedown in February.
"Higher-cost assets have been under pressure for some now, particularly at older, labour-intensive mines (...Amandelbult). As the industry transitions to newer, mechanized mines (Mogalakwena...), older, higher cost mines will be rationalized," said BofA Securities analysts.
Palladium prices XPD= have plunged to a five-year low while rhodium, which soared to record highs of almost $30,000 an ounce in 2021, has since fallen to about $4,400 an ounce. Platinum prices XPT= have fallen 16% this year.
STALLING GROWTH
The sector's cost-cutting measures, also taken by junior platinum miners, come as Africa's most industrialized economy grew just 0.3% in the first nine months of this year.
Platinum mines earned the country about 275 billion rand(about $14.6 billion) in export receipts last year, according to Minerals Council South Africa data. The mines, some of which are among the world's deepest, employ about 175,000 workers.
Some of those jobs are now evaporating.
Sibanye, the biggest mining employer in South Africa, in October said it plans to cut about 4,000 jobs and close some shafts. Rival Impala has a voluntary job cut process up to the end of the year, a spokesperson said.
"If the numbers are low then we may need to do more capital rationalization. More cost savings could include deeper labour initiatives like consulting with the unions (on section 189 process) or extending the voluntary separation process," the spokesperson said.
The sector's woes may get even worse as EVs penetration increases in coming years.
"There will be significant demand destruction for PGMs, especially palladium and rhodium, though limited for platinum, starting 2028 due to battery electric vehicle penetration, and as PGMs demand for auto-catalysts decline," Citigroup analysts said.

    <nas:hasContent>Given its better prospects, we believe Alaska Air stock  (NYSE: ALK) is a better pick than its peer, American Airlines stock (NASDAQ: AAL). AAL is trading at a lower valuation of  0.2x revenues than 0.5x for ALK. Investors have assigned a higher multiple to Alaska Air stock due to its better financial position, as discussed below. In the sections below, we discuss why we believe that ALK will offer better returns than AAL in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, stock returns, and valuation, in an interactive dashboard analysis of American Airlines vs. Alaska Air: Which Stock Is A Better Bet? Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
AAL stock has seen a decline of 20% from levels of $15 in early January 2021 to around $12 now. ALK stock has also seen a decline of 20% from levels of $50 in early January 2021 to around $40 now, vs. an increase of about 20% for the S&amp;P 500 over this roughly 3-year period.
Notably, AAL stock has underperformed the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 14% in 2021, -29% in 2022, and -4% in 2023 (YTD), while returns for ALK stock were 0% in 2021, -18% in 2022, and -13% in 2023 (YTD). In comparison, returns for the S&amp;P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 19% in 2023 (YTD) – indicating that AAL underperformed the S&amp;P in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and ALK underperformed the S&amp;P in 2021 and 2023.
In fact, consistently beating the S&amp;P 500 – in good times and bad – has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Industrials sector, including BA, UNP, and UPS, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could AAL and ALK face a similar situation as they did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&amp;P over the next 12 months – or will they see a recovery? We expect a rebound in both stocks in the next three years, but ALK will likely fare better between the two.
1. American Airlines’ Revenue Growth Is Slightly Better
American Airlines’ revenue growth has been slightly better, with a 25% average annual growth rate in the last three years, compared to 23% for Alaska Air.
The rise in revenues for both airlines over the recent years can be attributed to a rebound in air travel demand, with passenger traffic and ticket yield rising meaningfully in recent years.
For perspective, American Airlines’ available seat miles (ASM) declined 25% between 2019 and 2021 but surged 21% y-o-y in 2022. Similarly, its passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) fell 18% between 2019 and 2021 but rose 41% y-o-y in 2022.
In comparison, Alaska Air’s ASM declined 21% between 2019 and 2021 but surged 16% in 2022. Similarly, its PRASM fell 11% between 2019 and 2021 but rose 35% y-o-y in 2022.
Looking at the last twelve months, American Airlines’ 17% sales growth has fared better than 14% for Alaska Air.
The demand for air travel is expected to remain high in the near term, boding well for both stocks in the near future. However, the average ticket price has also cooled in the recent past while overall capacity has expanded.
For perspective, American Airlines’ revenue of $13.5 billion in Q3’23 was flat y-o-y. The company reported ASM growth of 7%, but the load factor declined 130 bps, and PRASM declined 6%. Similarly, Alaska Air’s revenue of $2.8 billion in Q3’23 was also flat y-o-y. Although the company reported a 14% rise in available seat miles, the load factor was down 190 bps, and yield declined 10%, weighing on its overall top-line growth.
Our American Airlines Revenue Comparison and Alaska Air Revenue Comparison dashboards provide more insight into the companies’ sales.
Looking forward, we expect Alaska Air to see better revenue growth than American Airlines.
2. American Airlines Is More Profitable 
American Airlines’ operating margin slid from 7% in 2019 to -60% in 2020 before recovering to 3% in 2022. In comparison, Alaska Air’s operating margin plunged from 12% in 2019 to -50% in 2020 before recovering to 1% in 2022.
Looking at the last twelve-month period, American Airlines’ operating margin of 7% fares better than 1% for Alaska Air.
Earlier this year, American Airlines closed negotiations with pilots, agreeing to an increase in pay by 46% over the next four years and this will result in higher costs for the company.
Alaska Air’s margin metric is partly being weighed down by the costs associated with the retirement of its Airbus fleet. Looking forward, the company is likely to have a better margin profile with lower costs associated with pilot training.
Our American Airlines Operating Income Comparison and Alaska Air Operating Income Comparison dashboards have more details.
3. Alaska Air Is Comparatively A Less Risky Pick
Looking at financial risk, Alaska Air fares better. Its 140% debt as a percentage of equity is lower than 419% for American Airlines, while its 16% cash as a percentage of assets aligns with that for the latter, implying that Alaska Air has a comparatively better debt position and a similar cash cushion.
The high debt-to-equity figures for both airlines can be attributed to much higher debt levels compared to their market capitalizations ($8 billion for AAL and $5 billion for ALK).
American Airlines’ total debt increased from $24.3 billion in 2019 to $33.5 billion now, while its total cash increased from around $4.0 billion to $11.5 billion over the same period. However, the rise in cash balance is primarily due to additional debt raised, as heavy negative operating cash flows in 2020 of $6.5 billion almost completely wiped out positive operating cash flows in 2019, 2021, and 2022.
In comparison, Alaska Air’s total debt increased from $3.2 billion in 2019 to $4.1 billion now, while its cash increased from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion over the same period. The rise in cash balance is partly due to additional debt raised, given the $4 billion negative operating cash flows in 2020.
4. The Net of It All
We see that American Airlines has seen superior revenue growth and is more profitable. On the other hand, Alaska Air has a better financial position.
Looking at prospects, using P/S as a base, due to high fluctuations in P/E and P/EBIT, we believe Alaska Air will likely offer better returns over the next three years, primarily due to its better-expected revenue growth.
If we compare the current valuation multiples to the historical averages, ALK fares better. American Airlines stock trades at 0.2x sales compared to its last five-year average of 0.4x, and Alaska Air stock trades at 0.5x revenues vs. the last five-year average of 1.1x.
Our American Airlines (AAL) Valuation Ratios Comparison and Alaska Air (ALK) Valuation Ratios Comparison have more details.
The table below summarizes our revenue and return expectations for both companies over the next three years and points to an expected return of 5% for American Airlines and 45% return for Alaska Air over this period, based on Trefis Machine Learning analysis – American Airlines vs. Alaska Air – which also provides more details on how we arrive at these numbers.
While ALK may outperform AAL in the next three years, it is helpful to see how American Airlines’ Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

    <nas:hasContent>Investors in Advance Auto Parts Inc (Symbol: AAP) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2024 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AAP options chain for the new January 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.69/share today.
Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.27% return on the cash commitment, or 38.49% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advance Auto Parts Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAP stock at the current price level of $55.69/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $56.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.02% if the stock gets called away at the January 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Advance Auto Parts Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $56.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 47.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.69) to be 56%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

About Dashan Huang: Dashan Huang is an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University. His paper "Twin Momentum" looked at combining traditional price momentum with improving fundamentals to generate market outperformance. In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward. When he combined that measure with price momentum, he was able to double its outperformance.

    <nas:hasDate rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime">2023-12-16T18:00:00+00:00</nas:hasDate>
    <nas:hasContent>The latest trading session saw American Airlines (AAL) ending at $14.30, denoting a +0.42% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock fell short of the S&amp;P 500, which registered a gain of 0.59% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.68%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.66%.
Shares of the world's largest airline witnessed a gain of 14.84% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Transportation sector with its gain of 8.79% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.16%.
Market participants will be closely following the financial results of American Airlines in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect American Airlines to post earnings of $0.03 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 97.44%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $13.02 billion, reflecting a 1.29% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.
AAL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.40 per share and revenue of $52.76 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +380% and +7.73%, respectively.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for American Airlines. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.
Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.29% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, American Airlines boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that American Airlines has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.94 right now. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 7.58 of its industry.
It's also important to note that AAL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 0.11. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Transportation - Airline industry was having an average PEG ratio of 0.31.
The Transportation - Airline industry is part of the Transportation sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 189, finds itself in the bottom 25% echelons of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

    <nas:hasLsaSummary>Currently, American Airlines AAL.O, United, Delta and Southwest Airlines LUV.N control 80% of the domestic market, leaving little room for growth. By Rajesh Kumar Singh CHICAGO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Shortages of new planes, jet engines and pilots have left U.S. airlines with little choice but to pursue growth through acquisitions - which then puts them in the crosshairs of anti-trust regulators. While the Seattle-based airline flies Boeing's 737 planes, Hawaiian's fleet has a number of Airbus jets, so a combined company would have to rely on different parts and mechanics for repairs.</nas:hasLsaSummary>

The deal will provide Alaska - primarily a domestic carrier that flies narrowbody planes - Hawaiian's widebody jets, pilots and international networks, opening a runway for growth in long-haul international markets. Getting into long-haul international flying by using Hawaiian's fleet of wide-body jets and international networks is a better option, he said.</nas:hasLuhnSummary>

    <nas:hasContent>Aaron's Company, Inc. (AAN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this specialty retail have returned +23.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. The Zacks Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry, to which Aaron's belongs, has gained 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Aaron's is expected to post earnings of $0.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -66.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.09 points to a change of -47.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.99 indicates a change of -9.3% from what Aaron's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Aaron's is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Aaron's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $542.88 million indicates a year-over-year change of -7.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion estimates indicate -4.3% and +2.1% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Aaron's reported revenues of $525.68 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.4%. EPS of $0.01 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $537.29 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.16%. The EPS surprise was -83.33%.
Over the last four quarters, Aaron's surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Aaron's is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Aaron's. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

    <nas:hasContent>By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained ground on Monday as market participants parsed mounting expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the coming year and looked ahead to a week of crucial economic data.
A broad but modest rally boosted the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq to solid gains, while the Dow ended flat.
"Markets are heading in the direction of the Fed beginning to cut interest rates next year," said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "The data, whether it’s inflation, consumer spending or the labor market, are not ... deteriorating too fast or running too hot, so that Goldilocks scenario continues to play out."
Wall Street continues to build on seven straight weeks of gains, the S&amp;P 500's longest weekly winning streak since 2017.
The S&amp;P 500 is now about 1.2% shy of its all-time closing high, amid growing optimism regarding policy rate cuts in 2024, a fervor that Fed policy makers attempted to rein in on Monday.
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that the central bank has not pre-committed to cutting rates anytime soon, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said financial markets had got "a little bit ahead" of the central bank with respect to the timing and extent of interest rate cuts.
Even so, financial markets have priced in a 63.4% likelihood that the central bank will lower its Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at its March monetary policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
"There’s still a disconnect between investors pricing in five to six cuts next year and the Fed dots that show three," Hainlin added. "Markets continue to run ahead of the Fed and it seems to imply that it’s less important how many cuts, just that there’s going to be cuts."
Later in the week, the Commerce Department is expected to release its third and final take on third-quarter GDP on Thursday, to be followed by its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report on Friday, which will cover income growth, consumer spending, and crucially, inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI held steady at 37,306.02, the S&amp;P 500 .SPX gained 21.37 points, or 0.45%, to 4,740.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 90.89 points, or 0.61%, to 14,904.81.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&amp;P 500, communication services .SPLRCL advanced the most, with real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU ending the session red.
Mounting attacks by militant groups on ships in the Red Sea sent crude prices higher over supply concerns, which in turn boosted energy stocks .SPNY, which have largely been left behind by the recent rally.
S&amp;P 500 energy stocks added 0.8%.
United States Steel X.N jumped 26.1% to a more than 12-year high after Japan's Nippon Steel 5401.Tannounced it would buy the steelmaker in a $14.9 billion deal including debt.
Apple AAPL.O dipped 0.9% as China's ban on the company's iPhones and other foreign-made gadgets gathered momentum.
VF Corp VFC.N slid 7.8% following its announcement that it was investigating "unauthorized" activity on its computer systems, which disrupted some of its business, including the ability to fulfill orders on its e-commerce site.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&amp;P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 132 new highs and 107 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.75 billion shares, compared with the 11.88 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

    <nas:hasLsaSummary>By Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Four years after Goldman Sachs GS.N introduced a credit card with Apple AAPL.O, the Wall Street giant faces a costly exit from a partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable. In searching for a buyer for its share of the partnership, Goldman will face pressure from bidders to reduce the value of its stake in order to make the price more attractive, according to two sources familiar with the matter who declined to be identified discussing potential talks. New credit card businesses typically lose money in their early years, in part because regulations require banks to set aside about 7% of projected sales to cover expected losses, said Warren Kornfeld, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service.</nas:hasLsaSummary>

When Apple first shopped the deal with potential partners, other banks including JPMorgan Chase JPM.N passed because their potential cut of profits was too small, according to one of the sources familiar with the matter and a separate source who was also aware of Apple's original proposal, who declined to be identified discussing private negotiations. Goldman was responsible for setting aside the provisions for credit losses instead of sharing them with Apple, according to the two sources familiar with the business.</nas:hasTextrankSummary>
    <nas:hasLexrankSummary>By Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Four years after Goldman Sachs GS.N introduced a credit card with Apple AAPL.O, the Wall Street giant faces a costly exit from a partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable. Credit card issuers such as Synchrony Financial SYF.N, Citigroup C.N and Capital One COF.N would be logical partners to take on the venture if terms are changed, according to the two sources and another source familiar with the situation. Apple said it was focused on providing an "incredible experience" for customers, but declined to comment on the Goldman deal talks or terms.</nas:hasLexrankSummary>

About Partha Mohanram: Sometimes the best investing strategies don't come from the world of investing. Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper "Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.

    <nas:hasContent>InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips
As you may already suspect, there are not a lot of stocks up 1000% year-to-date, but several stocks trading on major exchanges are up 1000% from their lows set earlier in the calendar year. There are also a few fairly-liquid over-the-counter listed stocks that qualify for this category, whether by gaining tenfold since January, or by surging tenfold from an earlier low.
But no matter how they joined the “1000% Club,” the question now is whether any (or all) of these top performing stocks could knock it out of the park again in 2024. With this, let’s take a closer look, and find out.
Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI)
Source: John-Fs-Pic / Shutterstock.com
Up by 951.1% YTD, and by more than 1000% since its 2023 low, it’s an understatement to say that Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) has been one of the top performing stocks this year. Why have shares in this manufacturer of fiber optic networking products “crushed it” in terms of performance?
Chalk it up to surging expectations about an improvement in the company’s operating performance. As B. Riley’s Dave Kang argued in an August analyst upgrade of AAOI stock, several catalysts point to a rebound in sales and a material increase in Applied Optoelectronics’ margins.
That said, while AAOI has been a big winner for investors in 2023, that may not be the case for shares in 2024. Over the past few months, short interest with this stock has been rising. This may suggest that the “smart money” is betting big on disappointment down the road.
Arch Therapeutics (ARTH)

Trading at sub-$1 per share prices as recently as November, a recent run-up for bio-surgical products firm Arch Therapeutics (OTCMKTS:ARTH) has made it one of the stocks up 1000% or more this year. This recent hot run for this developer of advanced surgical wound care technology has likely been because of the release of a promising year-end operational update.
In the update, the company noted that it has “experienced a significant increase” in orders for its flagship wound care product. There is also speculation that OTC-listed ARTH stock is gearing up for an up-listing to the Nasdaq.
Still, given ARTH’s big jump in vague news and uplisting rumors, after climbing by more than tenfold in a matter of weeks, a significant reversal may be just around the corner. Consider digging more into this stock and its long-term potential, but stick to the sidelines for now.
Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG)

Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (OTCMKTS:BCHG) is one of many crypto-focused, closed-end funds managed by asset manager Grayscale Investments. This entity holds Bitcoin Cash (CCC:BCH-USD), not to be confused with Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) itself.
YTD, BCHG stock is up by 955.6%, and has surged by more than 1000% from its 2023 low. However, this ncrease comes even as BCH-USD itself is up by only 136.1% during this same time frame. As a result, shares have gone from trading at a significant discount to a significant premium to the fund’s net asset value.
For savvy investors, there may be ways to exploit this valuation premium, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently discussed. However, for most everyday investors, this premium is a clear warning sign to stay away from BCHG. Those bullish on BCH-USD can simply buy it directly through an exchange.
BlueFire Equipment (BLFR)

So far this year, BlueFire Equipment (OTCMKTS:BLFR) shares have increased in price to the tune of 1,618.75%. Yet while it’s definitely one of the stocks up by more than 1000% this year, whether it’s also currently one of the top stocks to buy is another question entirely.
There are many red flags with BLFR stock. For one, the company does not have a functioning website. Shares seem to have surged following a series of corporate developments. Given the spate of press releases touting these developments, it appears as though BlueFire is trying to gin up hype for the stock.
Perhaps, in order to raise capital through the sale of newly-issued shares. Even as BLFR has reduced its authorized common share count, the current authorization level (250 million shares, versus 34.1 million shares currently issued and outstanding) leaves plenty of room for dilutive secondary offerings.
Myomo (MYO)
Source: Shutterstock / PopTika
Similar to ARTH, Myomo (NYSEAMERICAN:MYO) is another of the stocks up 1000% this year that’s a medical technologies play. Myomo develops and sells wearable medical robotics products that help to improve the quality of life of those with neuromuscular disorders.
The latest big jump for MYO stock has followed the release of the company’s latest quarterly results and corporate updates. News of increased revenue, margins, and backlog has made the market considerably more bullish on MYO’s future prospects. Better yet, in contrast to some stocks listed above that arguably went up too far, too fast, Myomo could keep climbing in 2024.
With a potential customer base numbering in the millions, and Myomo already generating millions in revenue from selling thousands of units, achieving a level of growth needed to keep the needle moving appears to be well within the realm of possibility.

Safety Shot (NASDAQ:SHOT) may be the best-known among the stocks up 1000% this year. Among both investors and consumers, that is. As you may know, Safety Shot has been in the news lately regarding its eponymous detoxification beverage which purports to quickly reduce blood alcohol content.
But while there’s enormous potential with this product, for now said potential may be more than accounted for in the current valuation of SHOT stock. The stock currently has a market cap of $157.4 million, and only commercialized Safety Shot. The effectiveness of this product has yet to be evaluated by regulators.
Shares have pulled back to around $3.80 per share, after trading for as high as $7.50 per share. Company insiders have started to cash out as well. Even if you believe this product will be a blockbuster in terms of sales, take your time before buying.
Soleno Therapeutics (SLNO)

As I hinted above, Soleno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SLNO) is the only stock trading on a major exchange that has gained by more than 1000% since the first trading day of 2023.
Considering it’s the most bona fide 1000% stock from this year, does that make it a top name to consider heading into 2024? Maybe, maybe not.
SLNO stock has gained by quadruple-digits this year, due to the September release of clinical trial data for this clinical-stage biotech firm’s flagship drug candidate, diazoxide choline. Said trial data for this treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome symptoms is perceived to bode well for DCCR’s chances of making it to market.
Still, as InvestorPlace’s Thomas Yeung argued last month, high potential with SLNO comes with it high uncertainty and risk. It may be better to wait for major weakness before (possibly) making this stock a small, speculative buy.

Dec 8 (Reuters) - European shares were muted on Friday, as a drop in miners offset gains in energy stocks, while investors assessed Germany's inflation data and keenly awaited a key U.S. employment report to reaffirm expectations of a peak in global interest rates.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX rose 0.1% and was headed for a fourth consecutive week of gains.
Energy .SXEP shares added 0.5%, tracking higher crude prices.
Miners .SXPP fell 0.8% after Anglo AmericanAAL.L slumped 6.2% on plans to reduce capital expenditure by $1.8 billion across its businesses by 2026.
All eyes will be on the U.S. Labor Department's report on November non-farm payrolls, due later in the day, for clues on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook.
Meanwhile, the latest data showed German inflation eased in November, bolstering the case for a peak in eurozone interest rates.
In corporate news, VivendiVIV.PA climbed 3.2% to the top of the STOXX 600 as the media firm is set to replace Worldline WLN.PA on the CAC40 index, effective from Dec. 18.

    <nas:hasContent>For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – December 14, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Constellation Energy Corp. CEG as the Bull of the Day and Winnebago Industries WGO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Applied Optoelectronics AAOI, IonQ IONQ and Vertiv VRT.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Constellation Energy Corp. is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and a compelling standout in the Utilities sector because of its exposure to nuclear energy. Furthermore, analysts are forecasting very strong long-term EPS share growth, which combined with its historically discounted valuation makes it a top-tier investment consideration.
Company Summary
Constellation Energy Corporation is the country's leading producer of carbon-free energy, powering 20 million homes and making up 10% of the nation's renewable electricity. Through its diversified energy assets, including nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar generation facilities it is leading the industry in the transition to renewable utilities.
Constellation as set ambitious goals intending to produce 95% carbon-free electricity by 2030, 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, a 100% reduction of operations-driven emissions by 2040 and providing 100 percent of business customers with customized data to help them reduce their own carbon footprints.
Earnings Estimates
Analysts have been steadily revising earnings estimates over the last five months, giving it a top Zacks rank, and powering a 36% YTD return. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 28% and are expected to climb 1,500% YoY to $1.64 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have increased by 34% and are projected to climb to $7.44 per share.
Valuation
Even with the strong appreciation in the stock, CEG still boasts a very fair relative valuation. It is currently trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 15.4x, below the industry average of 17.2x, and below its two-year median of 20.3x.
Additionally, with EPS forecast to grow an average 26.3% annually over the next 3-5 years, CEG also enjoys a bargain PEG ratio. Considering the growth estimates and earnings multiple its PEG ratio is 0.58x, indicating a value investing opportunity.
Bottom Line
For investors looking to add exposure to alternative energy stocks, Constellation Energy Corporation is a worthy consideration. Its ambitious and innovative vision, along with its reasonable valuation and strong growth estimates also make it a unique option in the utilities sector.
Bear of the Day:
Winnebago Industries, the country's leading producer of recreational vehicles, is bumping up against the obstacle of late business cycle economics, as consumers reduce discretionary spending and tighten budgets. In addition to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating, it still has a historically elevated valuation, possibly not pricing in a further slowdown in consumer spending.
Because of these developments, I think investors should look for other opportunities.
Earnings Estimates
Analysts have unanimously lowered the expectation for Winnebago Industries earnings, giving it the lowest Zacks Ranks.
Current quarter earnings have declined by -12% and are forecast to fall -40% YoY to $1.25 per share. FY24 earnings have been revised lower by -5.6% and are projected to decrease by -14.3% YoY to $6.57 per share.
Technical Perspective
WGO stock has been trading in a wide range all year and was just denied by the upper level of resistance. I think it is likely that the lower level of support will be retested at some point in early 2024, making this stock one investors should avoid.
Valuation
Winnebago Industries is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 10.5x, which is below the industry average and above its five-year median of 9x. The company has also been increasing the share count over the last several years, and the shares outstanding jumped 11% in just the last year.
Bottom Line
Although Winnebago Industries is an industry leading company that likely has a positive long-term future, the near-term prospects for the stocks are not good. Investors should explore other industries as the market and economy digest the shifting environment.

3 Tech Stock Crushing the "Magnificent 7" in 2023
In the current investment landscape, the focus has shifted from the FANG stocks, and a new set of influential stocks, known as the Magnificent Seven Stocks, has emerged. These stocks include Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These companies are considered the new leaders in the stock market.
There is a pureplay ETF called Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF on this theme. The ETF has surged more than 30% this year. Individually, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are up more than 50% each, Meta shares are up about 165%, Amazon has gained 70%, Nvidia has skyrocketed about 233% and Tesla is up nearly 118% this year.
But there are three tech stocks that have beaten even the best of Magnificent Seven, i.e., Nvidia.
Inside the Dominance of Magnificent Seven
The Magnificent Seven stocks have a significant impact on the Nasdaq index, as they collectively account for a major portion of its total weighting. Despite recent fluctuations in the market, some of the Magnificent Seven Stocks, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, and Meta, continue to exert a substantial impact on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index mainly due to their meaningful positions in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) space. The AI boom made them stars in 2023.
What About Other Tech Jewels?
Even in the narrow market breadth, some tech companies shined. With the Fed expected to go slow on its rate hike spree in 2024 (or even cut rates in late 2024), overall tech space should do well as the area thrives better in a low-rate environment.
Already, market breadth has continued to broaden, and smaller tech companies are likely to excel. Plus, the AI boom is ongoing, which is expected to push the space to another height next year.
Stock to Watch
Below, we highlight those winning tech stocks that trumped even Magnificent Seven in 2023. Since these stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), these winners have more room for growth going into 2024.
Applied Optoelectronics – Up 888.3% YTD
Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. designs, develops and manufactures advanced optical devices, packaged optical components, optical subsystems, laser transmitters and fiber optic transceivers. The Zacks Rank #3 company belongs to a top-ranked Zacks sector (top 31%).
IonQ– Up 268.8% YTD
IonQ Inc. provides a quantum system through the cloud on Amazon Braket, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, as well as through direct API access. IonQ Inc., formerly known as dMY Technology Group Inc. III., is based in COLLEGE PARK, Md. The Zacks Rank #2 company hails from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 36%) and sector (top 31%).
Vertiv– Up 271.7% YTD
Vertiv Holdings Co provides digital infrastructure and continuity solutions. It offers hardware, software, analytics and ongoing services. The Zacks Rank #1 company belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 21%) and sector (top 31%). Two out of three analysts upped their earnings estimates for the upcoming quarter over the past one month.

    <nas:hasContent>Fintel reports that on December 13, 2023, Wolfe Research initiated coverage of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) with a Outperform recommendation.
Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 1.04% Downside
As of November 27, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 132.34. The forecasts range from a low of 101.00 to a high of $157.50. The average price target represents a decrease of 1.04% from its latest reported closing price of 133.74.
See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.
The projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 4.35%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77.
Agilent Technologies Declares $0.24 Dividend
On November 15, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share ($0.94 annualized). Shareholders of record as of January 2, 2024 will receive the payment on January 24, 2024. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share.
At the current share price of $133.74 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.71%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.72%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.14 (n=235).
The current dividend yield is 0.12 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.22. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.22%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.
What is the Fund Sentiment?
There are 1945 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies. This is an increase of 30 owner(s) or 1.57% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to A is 0.31%, a decrease of 2.75%. Total shares owned by institutions increased in the last three months by 1.25% to 300,740K shares.
The put/call ratio of A is 1.01, indicating a bearish outlook.

It’s the end of the year, which means that it’s time to dust off the crystal ball and look at some top stock predictions for 2024. What will the year ahead bring for the stock market and equities? That’s the questions analysts and traders are trying to answer as they close out 2023 and look ahead to 2024.
Opinions on where the market is heading seem to differ widely with both bulls and bears represented in the 2024 forecasts. Some market observers continue to expect a recession in 2024 and a downturn in corporate earnings. Others see bulls stampeding across the market as interest rates and bond yields move lower. Where it all ends up is anyone’s guess. However, we would be remiss if we didn’t offer a few top stock predictions for 2024 of our own. Here are seven bold stock predictions for the year ahead.
Stock Predictions for 2024: Gold Prices Continue To Rise
Source: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com
The price of gold just hit an intraday all-time high of $2,110.80. And there’s word the metal has formed a “golden cross,” a technical chart pattern that has historically proven to be a bullish sign for the commodity. Essentially, the golden cross indicates that the price of bullion is likely to continue rising in the near term.
Demand for the safe-haven asset continues to be strong heading into the new year, with many analysts forecasting that gold’s price will remain above $2,000 throughout 2024. In addition to geopolitical uncertainty, other tailwinds are a weaker U.S. dollar and expectations that interest rates will move lower in the coming year. Also, a recent survey by the World Gold Council found that 24% of central banks intend to increase their gold reserves over the next year.
Bitcoin’s Price Hits An All-Time High

Cryptocurrencies continue to surge higher, with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) leading the charge. At nearly $44,000, the price of BTC has gained 164% in 2023 and is now at its highest level since April 2022. That said, the price of Bitcoin remains well below its all-time high of $68,000 reached in November 2021. That could change in 2024, especially if spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as is widely expected.
While some analysts are confidently predicting that Bitcoin’s price will reach $100,000 in the year ahead, that outlook seems a little aggressive. However, it’s not out of the realm of possibility for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high in the coming year. Certainly BTC could hit $70,000 or $75,000 in the next 12 months, especially as it is currently on track to reach $50,000 before the calendar changes to 2024 in a few weeks. With interest rates expected to fall, investors’ appetite for riskier assets such as crypto can be expected to intensify in coming months.
Stock Predictions for 2024: Nvidia’s Stock Doubles (Again)
Source: Evolf / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock tripled in 2023 and has been one of the best-performing securities in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. However, despite the big rally this past year, NVDA stock is still undervalued, especially after its recent pullback following its earnings print. Among 47 analysts who track Nvidia’s progress, the median price target on the stock is 40% higher than where the shares currently trade. The lowest target is 15% higher than the current share price.
It’s likely only a matter of time before market sentiment catches up to reality with NVDA stock. And given its blockbuster growth and overwhelming demand for its microchips and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, it’s not inconceivable for NVDA stock to double again in 2024. This is especially likely if the company continues to post blowout quarterly results that obliterate Wall Street forecasts. Also worth noting is that NVDA stock is attractively valued right now and cheaper than other mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The Fed Won’t Cut Rates Until The Second Half Of The Year

While the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done raising interest rates, the timing of when it will begin lowering them remains in question. Futures traders are being aggressive with a 65% probability that the first Fed rate cut will occur in March 2024. By September, traders expect that the Fed Funds Rate will have declined by 250 basis points to 3%. That’s an extremely bullish outlook that doesn’t quite jibe with the current economic data or inflation itself.
The most recent numbers showed that the U.S. economy grew at a 5.2% rate in this year’s third quarter, which was even stronger than first indicated. Employment remains strong, and while inflation has been declining, at 3.2%, it remains well above the Fed’s annualized 2% target. While many economists continue to hold out hope for a recession to appear, none has emerged. And although markets continue to try and call Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s bluff, he remains adamant in his public remarks that the battle against inflation isn’t over. All this could mean that we don’t get the first rate cut until next summer.
Stock Predictions for 2024: Airline Stocks Stage A Comeback
Source: m.photo / Shutterstock.com
Airline stocks continued to underperform in 2023 and failed to recover from the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic. As 2023 comes to a close, the share price of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is up only 2% on the year versus a 20% gain in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. However, this could change in the new year as air travel moves ahead of pre-pandemic 2019 levels and amid a wave of consolidation among smaller carriers in the industry.
Heading into the recent Thanksgiving holiday weekend, airlines in the U.S. were preparing for a record number of travelers. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipated the busiest ever Thanksgiving travel weekend with more than 30 million people passing through U.S. airports. Even before Thanksgiving, 2023 proved to be the busiest year on record for air travel. Seven of the 10 busiest days in U.S. air travel history occurred in the last six months. That bodes well for airlines that are still recovering from the pandemic when they lost a combined $168 billion.
Small-Cap Stocks Finally Recover
Source: iQoncept / Shutterstock
It’s been a tough slog for small-cap stocks. Smaller capitalized stocks have trailed large caps for about a decade now, and that underperformance continued in 2023. The Russell 2000 index has gained 6% over the last year, less than a third of the 20% gain seen in the S&amp;P 500 index. The lack of a meaningful recovery in small-caps has frustrated many analysts, with some saying it is a sign that the market is not healthy and overly concentrated in only a handful of stocks.
The good news is that there are tentative signs that a recovery in small-cap stocks might be underway. As the broader market pulled back to start December, professional traders were buying small-cap stocks. On Dec. 4, the Russell 2000 outperformed the Nasdaq Composite index by more than 1 percentage point for the second consecutive trading day, the first time that has happened in more than six months. Also, while the Russell 2000 is up 6% on the year, it has risen 12% since the end of October, indicating that momentum is building. The year ahead could finally see a turning point for small-caps.
The S&amp;P 500 Hits A New All-Time High
Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock
The S&amp;P 500 is currently 5% below the all-time high of 4,796.56 that it reached on Jan. 3, 2022. Could it rise another 5% over the next year to reach a new all-time high? It’s not out of the realm of possibility, especially as several bullish catalysts form in the market. Right now, bond yields are falling, interest rates look to have peaked, and the economy remains strong. All of this bodes well for the stock market moving higher throughout 2024.
If we do indeed get a “soft landing” and manage to tame inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, then the market can be reasonably expected to rally higher in the next year. While their predictions differ, most analysts agree that equities are likely to rise sharply once the Fed does begin to cut interest rates and move them lower. Should bond yields continue to decline, it will serve as a huge catalyst for stocks. While nobody can predict the future, the current signs point to a bull run in 2024.

    <nas:hasContent>Warren Buffett has led the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) for more than 50 years. Between 1965 (when he took control of Berkshire) and 2022, the shares delivered a whopping 3,787,464% gain.
That translates to a 19.8% compound annual return, which is about twice the return of the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. It could have turned an investment of just $100 in 1965 into more than $3.7 million today. By comparison, the same investment in the S&amp;P 500 at that time would have grown to just $24,700.
Buffett has a simple, but effective strategy
The simplest investment strategies are often the best. Buffett likes to buy stakes in profitable companies that are delivering steady growth, especially if they have strong management teams. He also favors companies returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
He combines those attributes with a long time horizon, which allows the effects of compound growth to build his portfolio's value.
Buffett certainly doesn't chase the lateststock market trends even those as strong as artificial intelligence (AI), which whipped investors into a frenzy throughout 2023. That said, Berkshire does own several AI stocks, even if AI isn't the reason Buffett and his team originally purchased them.
Investors might be surprised to know the following three AI stocks account for a whopping 49.1% of Berkshire's $373 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks.
Image source: The Motley Fool.
1. Snowflake: 0.3% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio
Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) is a leading provider of cloud computing services to businesses. It only represents 0.3% of Berkshire's portfolio, but it's quickly becoming one of the most direct AI plays owned by the investment company.
Snowflake's Data Cloud was revolutionary when it launched in 2018. It helps large, complex organizations aggregate their data from different cloud providers so it's all in one place for maximum visibility. From there, companies can use powerful analytics tools to draw valuable insights from the data.
Snowflake recently launched Cortex, a brand new platform featuring AI tools to complement its cloud services. It Document AI service uses a large language model to help businesses extract valuable insights from data in unstructured formats like contracts or invoices. Then there is Universal Search, which allows users to find critical information within Snowflake using natural language instead of programming language, so even non-technical employees can draw value from their organization's data.
Cortex also includes a generative AI-powered chatbot called Snowflake Copilot, which serves as a virtual assistant. It's capable of turning text-based prompts into computer code, which can rapidly speed up software development.
Snowflake continues to expand its workforce, with its research and development department growing the fastest. That bodes well for future product releases on the AI front, which will create new opportunities to generate revenue. The company expects to bring in $2.6 billion for its fiscal 2024 (which ends Jan. 31), but it isn't profitable, nor does it pay a dividend.
Berkshire's decision to invest in Snowflake stock was likely made by a portfolio manager rather than by Buffett himself. Nonetheless, it's shaping up to be a great long-term AI play.
2. Amazon: 0.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the most diverse technology companies in the world, with dominant positions in industries like e-commerce, cloud computing, streaming, and digital advertising. Now, it's quickly becoming one of the most diverse opportunities in AI.
Amazon is focused on delivering the widest possible range of AI products and services to businesses through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company has already launched its own data center chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which are designed to compete with Nvidia's industry-leading hardware. Plus, AWS offers businesses a growing number of large language models to accelerate the development of AI applications.
In fact, Amazon recently made a $4 billion investment into leading AI start-up Anthropic. As part of the deal, AWS will be Anthropic's primary cloud provider, and Anthropic will train its future models on Amazon's chips. Plus, Anthropic will make those models available to AWS customers, which will help differentiate the cloud platform from its competitors.
The cloud might be Amazon's most lucrative AI opportunity, but it isn't its only one. The company uses an AI recommendation engine on Amazon.com to show customers products they are most likely to buy. It also uses AI on its Prime streaming service during top broadcasts like the NFL's Thursday Night Football; it ingests millions of data points from each game to display key statistics that keep viewers informed at the highest possible level.
Berkshire Hathaway purchased Amazon stock in 2019, and its position is relatively small. But Amazon is on track to generate $523 billion in revenue in 2023, which is even more than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the largest company in the world. Given Amazon's growing exposure to AI, Berkshire might wish it owned more of the stock when it looks back in a few years.
3. Apple: 48.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio
Apple is worth over $3 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world. Berkshire started betting on the company in 2016, and it has since plowed about $35 billion into the stock. Its position is worth $181 billion as of this writing, so it accounts for a whopping 48.4% of Berkshire's stock portfolio.
That isn't surprising because Apple has all the attributes Buffett loves. Its chief executive officer, Tim Cook, has led the company to consistent growth and monster profits since he took the job in 2011. Plus, Apple returns enormous amounts of that money to shareholders, including $15 billion in dividends and $77.5 billion in stock buybacks during its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30) alone.
Consumers and investors know Apple best for hardware like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac personal computers. But the company subtly uses AI throughout all of them. AI powers the autocorrect feature on all Apple keyboards, and the Siri voice assistant. Apple Music also relies on AI to learn what listeners like, so it can feed them more of that content to keep them engaged.
Plus, the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip inside the new iPhone 15 lineup can power those AI workloads on-device faster than ever. As more smartphone features use AI, putting next-generation chips in those devices can reduce their dependence on external data centers for computing power, which leads to a faster, more seamless experience for the user.
Speculation also is swirling that Apple is pumping millions of dollars per day into AI units across the company -- units that are building everything from conversational AI models to generative AI applications, capable of crafting text, images, and videos. Reports suggest one such application, Ajax GPT, outperforms OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model -- the original technology that powered ChatGPT.
That suggests Apple is rapidly catching up to some of the leading developers in the AI industry, which could lead to powerful new features for its products in the coming years. Buffett and his team might look like rock stars if Apple becomes a real player in AI, given Berkshire's gigantic position in the stock.

    <nas:hasLsaSummary>By Stephanie Kelly and Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected this week to recognize a soon-to-be updated methodology favored by the ethanol industry in its guidance on how companies can gain access to credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. For months the administration has been divided over whether to recognize the Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model, which as it stands would enable ethanol-based SAF to qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law. The news is a win for the ethanol industry, which has countered environmental groups seeking standards that elevate feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fat.</nas:hasLsaSummary>

BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A federal judge considering the U.S. Justice Department's bid to block JetBlue Airways' proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines raised the possibility on Tuesday of letting the deal proceed if JetBlue divests more assets as the antitrust trial wrapped up.
U.S. District Judge William Young told a JetBlue lawyer that he expected airline fares would rise if no-frills, ultra-low-cost Spirit no longer was around to "undercut everyone else" and drive down prices.
But the judge, who will decide the case in the non-jury trial in Boston, told both sides that he was having "trouble" with the Justice Department's request for a permanent injunction blocking a deal in a "dynamic industry facing unique opportunities and challenges in the post-COVID environment."
Young raised the prospect of further divestitures by JetBlue, which has already agreed to sell-off gates and slots at airports in New York City, Boston, Newark, New Jersey and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to try to address U.S. regulators' concerns.
Lawyers for both sides delivered closing arguments in a trial that began on Oct. 31. The Justice Department, six U.S. states and the District of Columbia sued in March to challenge the merger as unlawfully harmful to competition in the airline industry.
Young said he had "seen cases where a court has decided the divestitures were close but not sufficient and then has proceeded to say this would pass muster if there were this divestiture or that divestiture."
Stressing his questions were not meant to signal how he would rule, Young asked Justice Department attorney Edward Duffy if he should do something similar if he concludes "what I have before me is insufficient and warrants some restraint" but that "with some more divestitures it might work."
Duffy responded that "there does not seem to be a remedy other than a full-stop injunction that would restore competition."
But JetBlue attorney Ryan Shores said it was within Young's power to craft such an order.
The case is part of an effort by President Joe Biden's administration to preserve competition among the lowest cost airlines and step up antitrust enforcement in various industries, an initiative that has yielded mixedresults in court.
Shores in his closing argument told the judge that the proposed merger was pro-consumer and was critical to allowing JetBlue to become a "viable, disruptive national challenge to the industry's dominant airlines."
The four largest U.S. carriers - United Airlines UAL.O, American Airlines AAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and Southwest Airlines LUV.N - control 80% of the domestic market. JetBlue and Spirit combined control about 8%, according to their lawyers.
Shores said that unlike the largest airlines that are flourishing in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic industry disruptions, lower-cost companies like JetBlue and Spirit have faced significant financial headwinds that would stifle their ability to meaningfully challenge the biggest airlines on their own.
Duffy said allowing JetBlue's, the sixth-largest U.S. airline, and Spirit, the seventh-largest, to merge would result in higher prices and fewer flights once lower-cost Spirit was no longer competing. JetBlue itself expects to raise fares 30%, Duffy said.
"This transaction is a bad deal for consumers," Duffy said. "It risks reduction in competition."

    <nas:hasContent>Fintel reports that on December 7, 2023, HSBC initiated coverage of Alcoa (NYSE:AA) with a Hold recommendation.

Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On October 18, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of October 31, 2023 received the payment on November 17, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $25.12 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.59%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.69%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.09 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.10. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.
What is the Fund Sentiment?
There are 877 funds or institutions reporting positions in Alcoa. This is a decrease of 3 owner(s) or 0.34% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to AA is 0.17%, a decrease of 3.28%. Total shares owned by institutions increased in the last three months by 1.16% to 166,346K shares.

    <nas:hasContent>By Stephanie Kelly and Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected this week to recognize a soon-to-be updated methodology favored by the ethanol industry in its guidance on how companies can gain access to credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
For months the administration has been divided over whether to recognize the Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model, which as it stands would enable ethanol-based SAF to qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law.
The news is a win for the ethanol industry, which has countered environmental groups seeking standards that elevate feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fat.
The administration, however, is also expected to announce that it will update the GREET methodology by March 1, the sources said.
That leaves some uncertainty for corn-based ethanol producers, as the administration is expected to ultimately tighten requirements around SAF feedstocks.
Over the coming months, a fierce lobbying push is expected.
The Treasury Department declined to comment for this story.
White House adviser John Podesta said on Thursday the SAF guidance would be released very soon.
"We think in order to take advantage of the credit that emissions have to be 50% below what oil-based aviation fuel looks like," Podesta told reporters on Thursday.

    <nas:hasContent>In recent trading, shares of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $30.60, changing hands for $31.10/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 10 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Alcoa Corporation, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $25.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $46.00. The standard deviation is $6.995.
But the whole reason to look at the average AA price target in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AA crossing above that average target price of $30.60/share, investors in AA have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $30.60 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Alcoa Corporation:

    <nas:hasContent>Investors in Advance Auto Parts Inc (Symbol: AAP) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2024 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AAP options chain for the new January 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.69/share today.
Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.27% return on the cash commitment, or 38.49% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advance Auto Parts Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAP stock at the current price level of $55.69/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $56.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.02% if the stock gets called away at the January 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Advance Auto Parts Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $56.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 47.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.69) to be 56%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

    <nas:hasContent>Year 2023, which is in its last leg, has witnessed extreme volatility from high interest rates and geo-political woes. However, cooling down inflation following the Fed’s interest rate hike policy to combat elevated inflation markets is a positive.
The Fed’s December FOMC meeting dot-plot has shown that, on average, Fed officials are expecting at least three rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2024, followed by four more rate cuts of one percentage point in 2025. Investors would like to take advantage of this optimistic forecast by designing a winning portfolio of stocks. However, doing this without proper guidance from investing experts is hazardous.
Experts in the field of investing are brokers, as they have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. Keeping tabs on broker-favored stocks like American Airlines AAL, ABM Industries ABM, Cardinal Health CAH,Cleveland-Cliffs CLF and Cencora COR in this scenario appears to be prudent.
Why Broker-Advice Works Wonders
Brokers have an in-depth understanding of stocks and great knowledge of the industry and the broader economy. They scrutinize the company’s fundamentals and place them against the prevalent economic scenario to find out how attractive a stock is as an investment option or otherwise.
Only after undertaking thorough research can brokers arrive at their recommendation (buy, sell or hold) on a stock. Such well-researched information is not available to individual investors. Therefore, they, in the absence of proper guidance, may end up selecting the wrong stocks in their portfolio. This might result in their hard-earned money, which they have invested in stock markets, going down the drain. To avoid such an unfortunate scenario from materializing, it is highly desirable for investors to be guided by broker advice, while deciding their course of action on a particular stock.
Formulating a Winning Portfolio
We have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks. However, considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof, as the top line has not been considered.
Actually, according to many market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more credible for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we have included the price/sales ratio in our screener as it serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.
Screening Criteria
 #(Up-Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of the top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks.
 Percentage change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives us the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past four weeks for the upcoming quarter.
To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:
Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10% of our universe of more than 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.
Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.
Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.
Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are in the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.
Com/ADR/Canadian = Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.
Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:
American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high operating costs are hurting the bottom line.
Over the past 30 days, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings being revised 1% upward. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
New York-based ABM Industries is a provider of integrated facility solutions in the United States and internationally. ABM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company has an impressive surprise history, with its earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters (missing the mark on the other occasion), the average beat being 1.4%.
The company's comprehensive transformational initiative called 2020 Vision has helped it attain long-term profitable growth through an industry-based go-to-market approach. Multi-year comprehensive strategic plan, ELEVATE is expected to accelerate ABM’s organic growth, improve its strategic and comprehensive positioning, and reinforce profitability.
Headquartered in Dublin, OH, Cardinal Health is a nation-wide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. The company’s diversified portfolio represents significant long-term opportunities. Further, it follows an acquisition-driven strategy.
CAH, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, has an impressive surprise history, with its earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 15.7%.
Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.
Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2024 earnings has been revised 6.34% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.
Chesterbrook, PA-based Cencora is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company should benefit from the strength in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions business. Cencora currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has inched up 0.5% over the past 60 days. COR has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters by an average of 3.88%.

NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Monday as market participants parsed mounting expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the coming year and looked ahead to a week of crucial economic data.
All three major U.S. stock indexes gained ground in a broad but modest rally, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq advancing the most and the Dow inching toward yet another all-time closing high, posting nominal gains.
Wall Street continues to build on seven straight weeks of gains, the S&amp;P 500's longest weekly winning streak since 2017, fueled by optimism of policy rate cuts in 2024, a fervor that Fed policy makers attempted to rein in on Monday.
The S&amp;P 500 was last about 1.1% shy of its all-time record close, reached in January 2022.
"It's a carry-over from the seven-week advance that we’ve seen, reflecting the confirmation by the Fed that they are likely finished raising rates and that they will start to cut interest rates at least by the second quarter of 2024," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. "But trees don’t grow to the sky, so sooner or later stocks will take a breather and digest some of these gains."
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that the central bank has not pre-committed to cutting rates anytime soon, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said financial markets had got "a little bit ahead" of the central bank with respect to the timing and extent of interest rate cuts.
Even so, financial markets have priced in a 63.4% likelihood that the central bank will lower its Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at its March monetary policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
"The Fed would like the market to respond in a more measured fashion, while also reminding investors that since the Fed is data-dependent, there's no guarantee that what we think today will actually come to fruition," Stovall added.
Later in the week, as the Christmas holiday draws near, the Commerce Department is expected to release its third and final take on third-quarter GDP on Thursday, to be followed by its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report on Friday, which will cover income growth, consumer spending, and crucially, inflation.
At 2:07 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 19.2 points, or 0.05%, to 37,324.36, the S&amp;P 500 .SPX gained 26.72 points, or 0.57%, to 4,745.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 107.49 points, or 0.73%, to 14,921.41.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&amp;P 500, communication services .SPLRCL were up the most, with real estate .SPLRCR suffering the biggest percentage drop.
Mounting attacks by militant groups on ships in the Red Sea sent crude prices higher over supply concerns, which in turn boosted energy stocks .SPNY, which have largely been left behind by the recent rally.
S&amp;P 500 energy stocks were last up 1.1%.
United States Steel X.N jumped 27.2% to a more than 12-year high after Japan's Nippon Steel 5401.Tannounced it would buy the steelmaker in a $14.9 billion deal including debt.
Apple AAPL.O dipped 0.7% as China's ban on the company's iPhones and other foreign-made gadgets gathered momentum.
VF Corp VFC.N slid 7.6% after the Vans sneaker maker said it was investigating "unauthorized" activity on its computer systems, an incident that disrupted some of its business, including the ability to fulfill orders on its e-commerce site.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&amp;P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 110 new highs and 90 new lows.

    <nas:hasContent>HANOI/BEIJING Dec 15 (Reuters) - Fees to process copper concentrate in the Chinese spot market have fallen by a quarter in less than three months to stand below $70 a metric ton on Friday, fanned by worries over tight supply.
The spot copper concentrate treatment charges (TC) in China, as assessed by information provider Shanghai Metals Market (SMM), hit $69.48 a ton, down 25% from $93.23 a ton on Sept. 28.
Such treatment charges, one of the main sources of income for smelters, fall when less copper concentrate is available, and vice versa.
"The expected shortage of copper concentrate may lead to a rapid decline in spot processing fees," SMM said in a note.
Chinese smelters were unable to buy enough copper concentrate, with some experiencing passive production cuts due to insufficient operating rates, it added.
SMM flipped its copper concentrate market balance forecast to a deficit of 200,000 tons to 300,000 tons for 2024, from a previous projection of a surplus of 70,000 tons.
Consultancy CRU Group also switched its forecast for 2024 to a deficit of 174,000 tons, from a previous 260,000-ton surplus projection.
Supply of copper concentrate next year turned tight after Panama's president ordered the closure of First Quantum's FM.TO Cobre mine. Miner Anglo American AAL.L also cuts its production guidance by 20% for 2024 and by 18% for 2025.
"Panama disruption is the main driver of the fees falling, right at the time Chinese smelters are stockpiling for the new year," said a source at a Chinese smelter.
However, trading volume on the spot concentrate market was tepid, as smelters were reluctant to accept lower fees and traders sought to hold back stocks or offer lower fees, accentuating supply tightness, another smelter source said.
CRU halved its output forecast for Cobre Panama mine to 50,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2023, from 102,000 tons. The mine's output will drop to zero in the first quarter of 2024, it said, adding that more than half usually goes to China.
The disruption in Panama was a key reason behind the drop in the annual TC benchmark for 2024 to $80 a ton, with smelters accepting the first fee drop in three years on fear of supply tightness.
China's biggest copper smelter, Jiangxi Copper 60362.SS, saw increasing challenges ahead for the country's smelters in securing copper concentrate, a company official said last month.

LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Copper prices climbed on Tuesday as supply concerns fuelled by mine closures, a sliding dollar and falling stocks in warehouses approved by the London Metal Exchange (LME) triggered buying.
Benchmark copper CMCU3 on the LME was up 1.3% at $8,596 a metric ton at 1701 GMT. Prices of the metal used in the power and construction industries this month touched 4-1/2 month highs of $8,640 a ton. Traders said volumes were subdued.
Analysts are cutting estimates of surpluses for next year or forecasting deficits, partly owing to uncertainty over supplies from First Quantum's FM.TO Cobre mine in Panama. Cobre accounted for 1% of global mined supply last year.
"There are a few micro issues going on in copper," said Marex strategist Alastair Munro, pointing to Cobre Panama along with reduced production guidance from Anglo American AAL.L and inventory data.
"Most of the flows in the metals space are from CTAs," he added, referring to funds that use trends to generate buy and sell signals from numerical models.
Anglo American has reduced its copper production guidance for the next two years by 20% and 18% respectively.
Copper stocks in LME warehouses MCUSTX-TOTAL have risen 8% to 168,650 metric tons since Dec. 6, but cancelled warrants -- metal earmarked for delivery -- at 21% suggest more copper is likely to leave the LME system.
Elsewhere, LME aluminium inventories rose again. At 511,450 tons they have risen 15% over the past couple of days and are weighing on prices of the metal used in the transport, packaging and construction industries.
Aluminium was down 0.8% at $2,265 a ton.
Traders expect further aluminium deliveries to the LME system after the British government imposed sanctions on imports of primary Russian metal.
Overall, industrial metals were supported by a lower U.S. currency, making dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, which could boost demand. FRX/
In other metals, zinc CMZN3 gained 1.6% to $2,580 a ton, lead CMPB3 firmed by 0.7% to $2,072, tin CMSN3 added 1.5% to $25,190 and nickel CMNI3 was up 1.3% at $16,715.

TOKYO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - A global aluminium producer has offered Japanese buyers a premium of $95 per metric ton for January-March primary metal shipments, down 2% from the current quarter, three sources directly involved in quarterly pricing talks said.
Japan is Asia's biggest importer of the metal and the premiums for primary metal shipments it agrees to pay each quarter over the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price CMAL0 set the benchmark for the region.
The figure is lower than the $97 per tonPREM-ALUM-JPpaid in October to December, which was down 24% from the prior quarter, and is the lowest since the January-March quarter this year.
The quarterly pricing negotiations began late last month between Japanese buyers and global suppliers, including Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX and South32 Ltd S32.AX, and are expected to continue until later this month.
The initial offer of $95 came from one global producer, while another supplier indicated a similar level although it was not an offer, a source at a Japanese trading house said.
"But buyers are demanding lower levels as spot premiums are hovering at around $80 amid dull demand and as Japanese companies want to reduce inventories ahead of the end of the financial year in March," the source said.
Aluminium stocks at three major Japanese ports AL-STK-JPPRT stood at 377,200 tonnes at the end of October, above 287,100 tonnes a year earlier, according to Marubeni Corp 8002.T.
Reflecting sluggish demand, Japan's shipment of aluminium sheets and extrusions fell 1.4% in October on year, marking the 20th consecutive month of decline, data of the Japan Aluminium Association shows.
Weakening premiums amid slack demand in Europe and the United States were also behind the buyers' requests for lower Japan premiums, another source at a local aluminium rolling mill said.
The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the discussions.

Dec 13 (Reuters) - Thungela Resources TGAJ.J does not plan broad job cuts at its South African coal mines despite ongoing output curbs, as it plans to re-deploy staff to new projects that will start producing next year, CFO Deon Smith said on Wednesday.
The thermal coal exporter's South African production will be 1 million metric tons lower this year than last, at 12.1 million tons.
In an update on Wednesday, the miner said it had reduced production because state-owned freight rail monopoly Transnet's services had been disrupted by "an increase in security-related issues as well as locomotive failures", constraining capacity to transport commodities to port.
The company had not launched a job restructuring process but relied on natural employee attrition and the targeting of areas mined by contractors as it reduced production, Smith said during an investor call.
He added that Thungela wanted to retain skills for its 4.2 million ton per year Elders mine, due to start production during the first half of 2024 to replace output from the Goedehoop colliery, which is approaching the end of its life.
Thungela is also extending the life of its flagship Zibulo operation by up to 12 years.
"We have pulled every single lever we can think of so far to keep our costs in check, but we’re not yet at a point where we need to necessarily restructure our business," Smith said when asked if the company was considering job cuts.
South Africa's rail crisis has also forced other South African bulk mineral exporters such as Kumba Iron OreKIOJ.J to cut production.
Transnet is on course to transport only 47 million tons of coal to port this year, lower than the 50.3 million tons last year and the lowest level in three decades.
Five years ago, Thungela, then a unit of Anglo American Plc AAL.L, exported 17 million tons of coal.
Thungela this year acquired Ensham mine in Australia as it diversifies away from South Africa and its infrastructure challenges.
Smith said Thungela was working on expanding production at Ensham, where output is expected to be 2.9 million tons this year, higher than the initial forecast of 2.7 million tons.

    <nas:hasContent>In recent trading, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $132.36, changing hands for $133.74/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agilent Technologies, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $146.00. The standard deviation is $12.779.
But the whole reason to look at the average A price target in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with A crossing above that average target price of $132.36/share, investors in A have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $132.36 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Agilent Technologies, Inc.:

    <nas:hasContent>By Pratima Desai
LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Copper prices came under pressure on Monday due to worry about weak demand in top consumer China, but mine closures and disruptions raising the prospect of tighter supplies helped support confidence.
Benchmark copper CMCU3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.5% at $8,509 a metric ton by 1050 GMT. Prices of the metal used in the power and construction industries touched four-month highs at $8,640 a ton this month.
China's troubled property market has weighed on industrial metals demand for most of this year, despite government measures to support the sector.
Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke expects energy transition demand for copper to offset the slowdown in China.
"The past few weeks have shown copper supply is quite vulnerable, Cobre Panama in particular," he said.
Copper has been climbing over the past two months due to uncertainty about supplies from First Quantum's FM.TO Cobre mine in Panama, accounting for 1% of global mined supply last year.
Also helping sentiment was Anglo American AAL.L cutting its copper production guidance by 20% and 18% for next year and 2025 respectively.
Expectations the Federal Reserve could cut U.S. interest rates in the first quarter of next year are weighing on the dollar which is hovering near 4-1/2-month lows against a basket of major currencies. FRX/
A falling U.S. currency makes dollar-priced metals cheaper for holders of other currencies, which could help demand.
However, the discount over the three-month copper contract CMCU0-3 near 31-year lows suggests the market does not expect imminent shortages on the LME.
Elsewhere, aluminium prices CMAL3 fell after data showed stocks in LME approved warehouses MALSTX-TOTA jumped 59,850 tons to 504,475 tons, the highest since early October.
However, the impact was brief as funds cutting short position pushed aluminium prices back towards the five-week highs of $2,269.50 a ton hit on Friday.
Three-month aluminium was up 0.6% at $2,261.
In other metals, zinc CMZN3 gained 0.6% to $2,547, lead CMPB3 advanced 0.3% to $2,088, tin CMSN3 slipped 0.5% to $25,050 and nickel CMNI3 dropped 1.8% to $16,840.

    <nas:hasContent>By Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen
NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Four years after Goldman Sachs GS.N introduced a credit card with Apple AAPL.O, the Wall Street giant faces a costly exit from a partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable.
In searching for a buyer for its share of the partnership, Goldman will face pressure from bidders to reduce the value of its stake in order to make the price more attractive, according to two sources familiar with the matter who declined to be identified discussing potential talks.
Goldman does not break out how much its stake is worth.
The expected unwinding of the Apple-Goldman partnership is another blow for CEO David Solomon's consumer strategy, which aimed to broaden the bank's revenue beyond its traditional mainstays of trading and investment banking.
The potential writedown on the Apple card would be the latest in a string of losses from Goldman's ill-fated foray into consumer banking, analysts said. Goldman does not break out the financial details of the card business in its results.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Prospective bidders will likely push Apple to change the terms of the deal, the two sources said.
They will likely seek access to Apple's proprietary credit card data, two other sources familiar with the business, said. Apple cardholders' data is not sold to third parties for marketing or advertising, according to its website.
Credit card issuers such as Synchrony Financial SYF.N, Citigroup C.N and Capital One COF.N would be logical partners to take on the venture if terms are changed, according to the two sources and another source familiar with the situation.
Synchrony declined to comment. Separately, its CEO Brian Doubles said at a conference this month that "you've got to have a really good risk-return equation" for card deals.
Citigroup C.N declined to comment. Capital One did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Apple recently sent a proposal that would enable Goldman to exit the contract in the next 12 to 15 months, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing people briefed on the matter.
Apple said it was focused on providing an "incredible experience" for customers, but declined to comment on the Goldman deal talks or terms.
'STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES'
After scaling back its retail ambitions last year, Solomon announced in February that Goldman was looking for "strategic alternatives" for its consumer unit.
The bank began talks with Apple under former Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who left in 2018, to create a credit card that would tap into the tech giant's enormous customer base. Stephen Scherr, who led Goldman's consumer division and later became its finance chief, was among its lead negotiators.
Solomon took the helm in late 2018 and the Apple card was introduced almost a year later. By 2022, the parties had renegotiated a deal that would last until the end of the decade, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Solomon told analysts in October that the bank was trying to get rid of the "drag" on earnings from its credit card business, which also includes a partnership with General Motors.
"Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts," Solomon said at the time. "And we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships."
Analysts interpreted his comments as a signal the card operations were losing money.
When Apple first shopped the deal with potential partners, other banks including JPMorgan Chase JPM.N passed because their potential cut of profits was too small, according to one of the sources familiar with the matter and a separate source who was also aware of Apple's original proposal, who declined to be identified discussing private negotiations.
JPMorgan declined to comment.
New credit card businesses typically lose money in their early years, in part because regulations require banks to set aside about 7% of projected sales to cover expected losses, said Warren Kornfeld, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service.
Goldman was responsible for setting aside the provisions for credit losses instead of sharing them with Apple, according to the two sources familiar with the business.
The Apple card also posed an underwriting challenge. Goldman's clients are typically wealthy individuals, and it had little experience making loans to less-affluent customers, according to analysts. As the two companies sought to boost revenue, they granted cards to customers with lower credit scores, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation.
As Goldman set aside more money for bad loans, the paper losses for its consumer business mounted, according to earnings filings.
The companies also tried to tempt new customers with the promise of "no annual fees, foreign transaction fees, or late fees," Apple said on its website.
They also introduced high-yield savings accounts for card holders in April, enabling Goldman to gather $10 billion of deposits by August, Apple said at the time.
Actual loan losses would eventually be shared among the two partners, one of the sources familiar with the business said. The business costs were also divided, with Apple paying for marketing while and Goldman handled customer service, the person said.
"Goldman had no meaningful presence in the credit card business," said Mike Taiano, vice president at Moody’s. "This was a big deal...they wanted to break into the card business, so they were probably willing to take less favorable economics."

Aluminium stocks at three major Japanese ports AL-STK-JPPRT stood at 377,200 tonnes at the end of October, above 287,100 tonnes a year earlier, according to Marubeni Corp 8002.T. Weakening premiums amid slack demand in Europe and the United States were also behind the buyers' requests for lower Japan premiums, another source at a local aluminium rolling mill said.</nas:hasLexrankSummary>

    <nas:hasContent>American Airlines Group Inc. AAL is benefiting from its strong air-travel demand and debt-reduction efforts.
Factors Favoring AAL
Continued recovery in air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, bodes well for American Airlines. Reflecting the boost in air-travel demand, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 8.3% in the first nine months of 2023. To cater to this increased demand, capacity (measured in average seat miles) increased 7% in the same time period.
The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. AAL aims to attain this objective through naturally occurring amortization. Also, it intends to utilize surplus cash and free cash flow to pay down prepayable debt. As of Sep 30, 2023, the carrier reduced its debt levels by more than $10 billion from peak levels in mid-2021.
Key Risks
American Airlines’ current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of third-quarter 2023 stood at 0.69. A current ratio of less than 1 is not desirable as it implies that the company doesn't have enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
Zacks Rank
AAL currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Key Picks
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Air Canada ACDVF and SkyWest SKYW.
Air Canada currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An uptick in passenger traffic is aiding ACDVF. Recently, management announced plans to launch a new year-round route between Montreal and Madrid.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The service will commence in May of the following year as part of its expanded international summer 2024 flying schedule to cater to increased demand.  
SkyWest currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). SKYW's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. Initiatives to reward its shareholders also bode well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has surged 83.3% in the past 60 days.
  Zacks Reveals ChatGPT "Sleeper" Stock
One little-known company is at the heart of an especially brilliant Artificial Intelligence sector. By 2030, the AI industry is predicted to have an internet and iPhone-scale economic impact of $15.7 Trillion.
As a service to readers, Zacks is providing a bonus report that names and explains this explosive growth stock and 4 other "must buys." Plus more.

    <nas:hasContent>Making its debut on 07/13/2016, smart beta exchange traded fund FlexShares STOXX US ESG Select Index Fund (ESG) provides investors broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.
If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.
Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.
Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.
Fund Sponsor &amp; Index
Because the fund has amassed over $204.22 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Blend. ESG is managed by Flexshares. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the STOXX USA ESG Impact Index.
The STOXX USA ESG Select KPIs Index is an optimized index designed to provide broad market exposure that is tilted toward U.S. companies that score better with respect to a small set of environmental, social and governance characteristics and to provide the potential for attractive risk-adjusted performance relative to the STOXX USA 900 Index.
Cost &amp; Other Expenses
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.32%.
The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.11%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 25.80% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Taking into account individual holdings, Amazon.com Inc Common Stock Usd 0.01 (AMZN) accounts for about 5.14% of the fund's total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT).
ESG's top 10 holdings account for about 34.71% of its total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 26.91% so far this year and is up about 26.91% in the last one year (as of 12/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $90.43 and $115.26.
The fund has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 17.87% for the trailing three-year period. With about 266 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
FlexShares STOXX US ESG Select Index Fund is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) tracks ---------------------------------------- and the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) tracks MSCI USA ESG Focus Index. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has $8.40 billion in assets, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF has $13.32 billion. JEPQ has an expense ratio of 0.35% and ESGU charges 0.15%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Blend.

    <nas:hasLsaSummary>Five years ago, Thungela, then a unit of Anglo American Plc AAL.L, exported 17 million tons of coal. In an update on Wednesday, the miner said it had reduced production because state-owned freight rail monopoly Transnet's services had been disrupted by "an increase in security-related issues as well as locomotive failures", constraining capacity to transport commodities to port. The company had not launched a job restructuring process but relied on natural employee attrition and the targeting of areas mined by contractors as it reduced production, Smith said during an investor call.</nas:hasLsaSummary>

    <nas:hasContent>A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Advance Auto Parts (AAP). Shares have added about 19.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Advance Auto Parts due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.
Advance Auto Posts Q3 Loss
Advance Auto incurred an adjusted loss of 82 cents per share for third-quarter 2023 against adjusted earnings of $1.92 in the year-ago quarter. The reported figure was also in contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $1.42 per share. Advance Auto generated net revenues of $2,719 million, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,679 million on higher-than-expected comparable store sales. Comparable store sales increased 1.2%. We projected an increase of 0.2%. The top line increased 2.9% year over year.
Advance Auto reported an operating loss of $43.7 million, down from operating income of $171 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022. SG&amp;A expenses totaled $1,030.4 million for third-quarter 2023, up 2.2% year over year.
Advance Auto had cash and cash equivalents of $317.5 million as of Oct 7, 2023 compared with $269.3 million on Dec 31, 2023. Total long-term debt was $1,785.7 million as of Oct 7, 2023, up from $1,188.3 million on Dec 31, 2022. From January through the third quarter of 2023, net cash provided by operating activities and negative free cash flow totaled $30.4 million and $156.8 million, respectively.
AAP’s board declared a cash dividend of 25 cents per share, which would be paid out on Jan 26, 2024, to all common shareholders of record as of Jan 12, 2024.
As of Oct 7, 2023, AAP operated 4,785 stores and 320 Worldpac branches in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It also served 1,307 independently owned Carquest-branded stores across these locations, in addition to Mexico and various Caribbean islands.
Advance Auto now estimates 2023 net sales in the band of $11.25-$11.30 billion compared with the previous guided range of $11.25-$11.35 billion. Comparable store sales are projected within a range of negative 0.5% to 0%. The operating income margin is envisioned in the range of 1.8-2%, down from 4-4.3%, guided earlier.
AAP expects 2023 capex in the range of $200-$250 million. The company projects FCF in the band of $50-$100 million, down from the prior guidance of $150-$250 million. Earnings are forecast between $1.40 per share and $1.80 per share, down from the previous estimate of $4.50-$5.10 per share. AAP now aims to open 55 to 65 new stores this year, up from the prior guidance of 40 to 60 stores.
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?
In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.
The consensus estimate has shifted -73.73% due to these changes.
VGM Scores
At this time, Advance Auto Parts has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.
Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Advance Auto Parts has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.
Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

    <nas:hasContent>Agilent Technologies A is enhancing its BioTek product line on the back of portfolio expansions and technology upgrades.

Notably, Agilent enhanced the BioTek Cytation C10 confocal imaging reader with the addition of water immersion and confocal spinning disk technology.

Further, the water immersion technology can be used in light microscopy to increase numerical aperture, reduce z-axis distortion, and improve image quality by placing water between the objective lens and sample.

Additionally, the technology aids researchers in reducing exposure times in live-cell applications, thereby reducing the traditional phototoxic effects associated with these experiments.

Moreover, this addition offers a deep-sectioning spinning disk technology, enhancing microscopic images by blocking out-of-focus light, resulting in clearer, more quantitative results.

Agilent is anticipated to gain significant traction among researchers utilizing live-cell and 3D applications on the back of its latest move.
Agilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus
Agilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote
Growth Prospects
The latest move positions the company well to strengthen its footing in the global microplate reader and live cell imaging markets.

Per a Grand View Research report, the global microplate reader market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period 2023-2030.

A Mordor Intelligence report indicates the global live cell imaging market size will reach $2.95 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.06% between 2023 and 2028.

We believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.

However, the company has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions.

Agilent has lost 13.9% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 0.9%.
ACG Segment in Focus
The latest move bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) segment.

Notably, Agilent Technologies launched Gen6 software for all Agilent BioTek detection instruments, offering automated optimization tools and improved navigation through built-in data analysis functions.

Further, the company introduced the Agilent BioTek 406 FX washer dispenser, a compact tool that combines reagent dispensing and plate-washing, suitable for automated systems and benchtop use.

All the abovementioned endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the ACG segment in the days ahead.

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the ACG segment revenues increased 6% year over year to $404 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues.

Our model projects fiscal 2024 ACG segment revenues at $1.64 billion, indicating growth of 4.7% from 2022.

Strong momentum in the underlined segment will likely aid its overall financial performance in the upcoming period.

    <nas:hasContent>By Felix Njini and Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo
JOHANNESBURG, Dec 16 (Reuters) - South Africa's High Court has ruled that a class action lawsuit against miner Anglo American AAL.L brought by victims of alleged historic lead poisoning in Zambia should not go ahead, lawyers for the claimants said on Saturday.
Victims of the alleged poisoning had accused Anglo's South African unit of negligence in controlling emissions of lead into the local environment at a mine it part-owned 50 years ago in Zambia's Kabwe district.
Anglo has previously denied the allegations and vowed to defend itself.
"We have stated from the outset that this claim is entirely misconceived and it is clear that the court recognised its multiple legal and factual flaws, deeming it not in the interest of justice for the class action to proceed," an Anglo American spokesperson said.
Anglo partly owned the Kabwe lead mine some 50 years ago. The mine was later owned by Zambian state-owned firm ZCCM-IH until 1994 when it was closed.
In a statement, lawyers for the claimants said the Johannesburg High Court had ruled in a 126-page judgment delivered on Friday evening that a claim against Anglo American South Africa (AASA) over widespread lead poisoning across Kabwe, Zambia, could not proceed as a class action.
The victims will appeal the ruling, the lawyers said.
'UNMANAGEABLE CLASS ACTION'
Among the concluding arguments in the ruling, the court said the application was seeking permission to advance an untenable claim that would set a grave precedent.
"The precedent is that a business could be held liable half a century after its activities have ceased, to generations not yet born, as a result of being tested against future knowledge and standards unknown at the time," the ruling said.
The court also said the class action would be "unmanageable" in that it would take a long time to be completed, after the applicants estimated it would take ten years for their legal team to take instructions from every member of the proposed classes.
"If this is so, it would take much longer for a South African court to assess the claim of each class member in the second stage."
"It bears emphasis that an unmanageable class action is not only adverse to Anglo's interests: It undermines the applicants' access to justice," the court said.
"Under the circumstances it is proper and necessary to dismiss the certification application."
South African law firm Mbuyisa Moleele and UK-based Leigh Day, acting on behalf of about 140,000 women and children of Kabwe, want Anglo held liable for failing to curb lead emissions from a smelter and waste dumps.
They also allege that Anglo was aware, before 1974, of the environmental damage and lead poisoning, including deaths of local children, and had ignored expert advice to remedy the situation before it handed over the assets to ZCCM-IH.

    <nas:hasContent>Have you been paying attention to shares of Aaon (AAON)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $71.67 in the previous session. Aaon has gained 41.9% since the start of the year compared to the 50.6% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 73.2% return for the Zacks Building Products - Air Conditioner and Heating industry.
What's Driving the Outperformance?
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 6, 2023, Aaon reported EPS of $0.64 versus consensus estimate of $0.55.
Valuation Metrics
Aaon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.
On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.
Aaon has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.
In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 34.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 29.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 41.8X versus its peer group's average of 26.9X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Aaon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Aaon meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Aaon shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.
How Does AAON Stack Up to the Competition?
Shares of AAON have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Lennox International, Inc. (LII). LII has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.
Earnings were strong last quarter. Lennox International, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 13.53%, and for the current fiscal year, LII is expected to post earnings of $19.64 per share on revenue of $4.9 billion.
Shares of Lennox International, Inc. have gained 9.6% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 24.99X and a P/CF of 27.06X.
The Building Products - Air Conditioner and Heating industry is in the top 10% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AAON and LII, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.
Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

    <nas:hasContent>NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected this week to recognize a methodology favored by the ethanol industry that will offer guidance on how companies can gain access to credits for sustainable aviation fuel production, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
For months the administration has been divided over whether to recognize the Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model, which would enable ethanol-based SAF to qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law.

    <nas:hasContent>Launched on 12/14/2012, the FlexShares Quality Dividend ETF (QDF) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Style Box - All Cap Blend category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.
But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor &amp; Index
The fund is sponsored by Flexshares. It has amassed assets over $1.66 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Blend. QDF seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index before fees and expenses.
The Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only U.S. equity securities, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust 1250 Index and the Index are selected based on expected dividend payment and fundamental factors.
Cost &amp; Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for QDF are 0.37%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.
QDF's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 2.19%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Most ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.
For QDF, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 31.40% of the portfolio --while Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 9.45% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp Common Stock Usd 0.00000625 (MSFT) and Procter &amp;no.38; Gamble Co/the Common Stock Usd 0 (PG).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 34.12% of QDF's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 19.10% so far this year and is up about 20.04% in the last one year (as of 12/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $51.86 and $61.93.
The fund has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 16.04% for the trailing three-year period, which makes QDF a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 143 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
FlexShares Quality Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
IShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) tracks S&amp;P Total Market Index and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) tracks CRSP US Total Market Index. IShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF has $48.85 billion in assets, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has $344.19 billion. ITOT has an expense ratio of 0.03% and VTI charges 0.03%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Blend.

    <nas:hasContent>The airline sector, which includes companies providing passenger and cargo air transport services, plays a crucial role in global travel. Influenced by economic conditions, oil prices, and geopolitical events, this industry is characterized by its cyclicality. Airlines’ profitability is closely tied to the global economy’s health, often operating on thin profit margins. These factors make the financial performance of airlines sensitive to external influences, reflecting the sector’s inherent volatility.
Investing in airline stocks presents a unique mix of advantages and challenges. These stocks can offer substantial growth during economic upswings and increased travel demand, making them attractive for tactical investments. However, they are also vulnerable to fuel price volatility, regulatory shifts, and unexpected events like pandemics. This susceptibility can cause significant price fluctuations. Taking all of this into consideration, here are three airline stocks to watch in the stock market this week.

    <nas:hasContent>When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?
Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.
Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 58.6% and 10.3% of all recommendations.
Brokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL


Check price target &amp; stock forecast for Apple here&gt;&gt;&gt;

The ABR suggests buying Apple, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every "Strong Sell" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five "Strong Buy" recommendations.
This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.
On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.
There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.
Is AAPL a Good Investment?
In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.56.
Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.

2023 proved to be a wild year, as many investors’ top-performing stocks quickly swirled down the drain amid higher interest rates and tightened economic conditions. But, against all odds, the market outlook improved rapidly in early fall before kicking off an early start to the Santa rally.
While it’s too early to say for sure, it seems like we’re ready to enter 2024 with a bang as stocks tick higher daily, though still below past highs. Better yet, some of the market’s biggest losers got shaken loose from most portfolios as companies entered a “sink or swim” phase, forced to adapt by focusing on financial fundamentals rather than growth at all costs.
Among the many top-performing stocks that made waves throughout 2023, these three stocks stand apart. They’ve returned 500% or more thus far, making them hot stocks to buy before 2024.
Carvana (CVNA)
Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com
Carvana (NYSE:CVNA), against all odds, jumped a whopping 753% since January. Shares in the online car shopping stock faced choppiness over the past few years as supply chain concerns drove used car pricing sky-high before markets normalized. At the same time, investors nervous about Carvana’s prospects saw limited profitability and questionable balance sheet stats as harbingers of doom.
That all changed in July when the company navigated a tricky debt situation and slashed a crippling leverage load. The clever financial engineering proved a boon to Carvana’s stock, and shares jumped more than 50% over a short period amid renewed investor enthusiasm.
Despite the top-performing stock’s record run, shares seem (surprisingly) undervalued today. Carvana trades at just 0.62x sales, though the company remains unprofitable. Still, the company’s balance sheet management bought Carvana much-needed breathing room and, if consumer sentiment keeps buyers away from purchasing cars new, Carvana stands to gain from a continued preference for used cars.
Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI)

Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) hit an impressive 880% return this year, but that isn’t the end of the story for this fiber-optic stock. Shares saw their bullish catalyst kickstart growth in August, as AAOI posted a surprisingly strong earnings beat. Some, but not all, of AAOI’s improved position came from a strategic partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), cementing its position as a top tech supplier.
Despite its recent strength, AAOI’s share pricing might be close to its upper limit. The company’s free cash flow (FCF) is, frankly, abysmal. The company is deep in the red, posting a negative $18 million FCF in the most recent quarter. To that end, AAOI’s current short interest is pushing past 25%, indicating institutional bearishness for this top-performing stock.
If you were lucky to get in on the ground floor of AAOI’s record bull run, you might want to consider taking some gains off the table. If you’re considering an investment in AAOI today, though, I’d be patient and give shares some time to settle into a more practical valuation before committing your capital.
Soleno Therapeutics (SLNO)
Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com
Soleno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SLNO) is arguably 2023’s top-performing stock, as shares climbed more than 1,600% since January. Biotech stocks are always a risky and speculative play, and viability hinges on regulatory approval balanced with maintaining enough cash to keep research running.
Most of Soleno’s race to the top came from positive results in therapeutic trials designed to treat a rare genetic disorder as investors weighed FDA approval possibilities. There’s stil a long way to go before Soleno brings the product to market, though, introducing uncertainty and risk moving forward.
Still, the company’s cash balance is reassuring as staggered cash infusions tied to outcomes keep bearing fruit. An interesting note is that, as part of the genetic disorder treatment, patient outcome is tied to weight loss. While Soleno’s management says they aren’t planning to enter the broader weight loss treatment market that’s been so popular this year, FDA approval could trigger off-label opportunities to make Soleno a top contender against companies like Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NOVO). That’s enough to keep investors hot on Soleno and provide a unique value proposition for the top-performing stock.

    <nas:hasContent>(RTTNews) - Tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL) has announced that it will halt sales of its flagship Apple Watch models in the United States.
According to 9to5Mac, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 will no longer be available to purchase from Apple starting later this week.
The Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 will no longer be available to order from Apple's website in the U.S. after 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, December 21. In-store inventory will no longer be available from Apple retail locations after December 24.
The decision is based on an ITC ruling related to a patent dispute between Apple and medical technology company Masimo around the Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensor technology.
The International Trade Commission announced its ruling in October, upholding a judge's decision from January. This sent the case to the Biden administration for a 60-day Presidential Review Period.
During this process, President Biden could veto the ruling, although this has not yet occurred. The Presidential Review Period expires on December 25, and Apple is making this announcement today to "preemptively" take steps to comply with the ITC's decision.
In a statement, Masimo said the ban "demonstrates that even the world's most powerful company must abide by the law."
"The ITC found that Apple stole Masimo's patented pulse oximetry technology, which measures blood oxygen," the company said. "The ITC undertook a thorough legal process and its expert judgment in this matter should be respected, protecting intellectual property rights and maintaining public trust in the United States' patent system."

    <nas:hasContent>By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained ground on Monday as market participants parsed mounting expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the coming year and looked ahead to a week of crucial economic data.
A broad but modest rally boosted the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq to solid gains, while the Dow ended flat.
"Markets are heading in the direction of the Fed beginning to cut interest rates next year," said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "The data, whether it’s inflation, consumer spending or the labor market, are not ... deteriorating too fast or running too hot, so that Goldilocks scenario continues to play out."
Wall Street continues to build on seven straight weeks of gains, the S&amp;P 500's longest weekly winning streak since 2017.
The S&amp;P 500 is now about 1.2% shy of its all-time closing high, amid growing optimism regarding policy rate cuts in 2024, a fervor that Fed policy makers attempted to rein in on Monday.
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that the central bank has not pre-committed to cutting rates anytime soon, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said financial markets had got "a little bit ahead" of the central bank with respect to the timing and extent of interest rate cuts.
Even so, financial markets have priced in a 63.4% likelihood that the central bank will lower its Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at its March monetary policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
"There’s still a disconnect between investors pricing in five to six cuts next year and the Fed dots that show three," Hainlin added. "Markets continue to run ahead of the Fed and it seems to imply that it’s less important how many cuts, just that there’s going to be cuts."
Later in the week, the Commerce Department is expected to release its third and final take on third-quarter GDP on Thursday, to be followed by its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report on Friday, which will cover income growth, consumer spending, and crucially, inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI held steady at 37,306.02, the S&amp;P 500 .SPX gained 21.37 points, or 0.45%, to 4,740.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 90.89 points, or 0.61%, to 14,904.81.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&amp;P 500, communication services .SPLRCL advanced the most, with real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU ending the session red.
Mounting attacks by militant groups on ships in the Red Sea sent crude prices higher over supply concerns, which in turn boosted energy stocks .SPNY, which have largely been left behind by the recent rally.
S&amp;P 500 energy stocks added 0.8%.
United States Steel X.N jumped 26.1% to a more than 12-year high after Japan's Nippon Steel 5401.Tannounced it would buy the steelmaker in a $14.9 billion deal including debt.
Apple AAPL.O dipped 0.9% as China's ban on the company's iPhones and other foreign-made gadgets gathered momentum.
VF Corp VFC.N slid 7.8% following its announcement that it was investigating "unauthorized" activity on its computer systems, which disrupted some of its business, including the ability to fulfill orders on its e-commerce site.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&amp;P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 132 new highs and 107 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.75 billion shares, compared with the 11.88 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

    <nas:hasContent>Warren Buffett is considered among the greatest investors of all time, having helped Berkshire Hathaway generate a compound annual gain of 19.8% from 1965 to 2022, smashing the S&amp;P 500's total return of 9.9%. With Buffett's long track record, investors would be wise to read about his techniques, which he generously shares in his annual letter to shareholders. In recent years, Buffett has highlighted the importance of retained earnings.
Let's delve into the retained earnings formula, explore why Buffett favors this metric, and highlight two stocks in Berkshire's portfolio that excel at it.
What are retained earnings?
Retained earnings is a line item on the balance sheet demonstrating a company's accumulated profits over its lifetime. It is calculated by taking a company's net lifetime earnings and subtracting its dividends paid (and any net losses). Companies can use retained earnings to expand, make acquisitions, pay down debt, and repurchase their stock.
Buffett prefers to simplify the metric by focusing only on a company's annual earnings and dividends paid. That is because share repurchases can significantly distort the metric you see on the balance sheet. One of Buffett's favorite stocks, Apple, has surprisingly low lifetime retained earnings, at -$214 million. This is because of Apple's sheer number of share repurchases through the constructive retirement method, which assumes the shares will never be reissued, affecting retained earnings. Notably, Apple spent $77.5 billion on share repurchases in its fiscal year 2023 ended Sept. 30.
Two Warren Buffett stocks that excel in retained earnings
Beyond best-in-class Apple, two stocks in Berkshire's portfolio also excel in retained earnings: Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and American Express (NYSE: AXP). In what is likely more than a mere coincidence, those two stocks are Berkshire's second- and third-largest holdings behind Apple, respectively.
First, Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the world by market capitalization, totaling about $265 billion. Over the trailing 12 months, Bank of America generated $30.5 billion in net income and paid roughly $9 billion in total dividends, resulting in retained earnings topping $21.5 billion during that time frame.
With its retained earnings, Bank of America has aggressively repurchased its stock -- retiring more than 18% of its shares outstanding over the past five years. Buffett recently wrote: "The math isn't complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices."
Nonetheless, despite Bank of America's share repurchases and a higher-than-average annual dividend yield of 2.9%, its stock has only generated a total return (price appreciation plus dividends) of 55% over the past five years, trailing the benchmark S&amp;P 500's trailing return of 97%.
Bank stocks have underperformed recently either due to self-inflicted wounds like scandals around opening fake accounts or macroeconomic events largely out of a bank's control, like rising interest rates. Nonetheless, using the common valuation metric for bank stocks of price-to-book ratio, Bank of America currently trades at 1, meaning the market isn't placing a premium on its net assets like it does competitor JPMorgan Chase's price-to-book ratio of 1.6. Additionally, Bank of America's five-year price-to-book ratio average is 1.1, suggesting it might be slightly underpriced based on recent history.
Image source: The Motley Fool.
Next, let's look at the global financial services company American Express, a company Berkshire Hathaway first purchased in 1991, and which generated $8 billion in net income over the trailing 12 months. With an annual dividend yield of 1.3%, the company paid $1.7 billion in dividends to its shareholders. As a result, American Express produced roughly $6.3 billion in retained earnings.
Like Bank of America, American Express is aggressively buying back its stock with retained earnings, lowering its shares outstanding by 14% over the past five years. During that time, American Express outpaced its larger competitors by market cap, Mastercard and Visa, in stock buybacks (those companies repurchased 9% and 8%, respectively).
In addition to its share repurchases, American Express has acquired five fintech companies since 2019 -- all private companies for undisclosed prices. The strategy has proven helpful in fueling revenue growth as the company most recently set a sixth consecutive quarterly record, generating $15.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023.
Finally, American Express stock appears attractive when assessed against its competitors through the widely used valuation metric price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. With a P/E multiple of about 17, American Express stands out as notably undervalued compared to Mastercard and Visa with P/E ratios of 36 and 31, respectively.
Are these two Warren Buffett stocks worth buying?
In 2020, Buffett wrote: "Retained earnings have propelled American business throughout our country's history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions of shareholders as well."
These two stocks, plus Apple, make up roughly 65% of Berkshire's $370 billion stock portfolio, meaning they are likely some of Buffett's favorite stocks. Given Berkshire's past success, investors would be smart to follow the Oracle of Omaha's strategy and consider adding Bank of America and American Express to their portfolios.

    <nas:hasContent>By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Shortages of new planes, jet engines and pilots have left U.S. airlines with little choice but to pursue growth through acquisitions - which then puts them in the crosshairs of anti-trust regulators.
Alaska Airlines ALK.N surprised analysts and industry officials with its plan to buy Hawaiian AirlinesHA.O for $1.9 billion even before a judge rules on the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) lawsuit aimed at blocking JetBlue's JBLU.O proposed merger with Spirit Airlines SAVE.N.
But supply and labor constraints are so onerous that airlines like Alaska will likely keep chasing deals despite the Biden administration's aversion to more consolidation. Currently, American Airlines AAL.O, United, Delta and Southwest Airlines LUV.N control 80% of the domestic market, leaving little room for growth.
The deal will provide Alaska - primarily a domestic carrier that flies narrowbody planes - Hawaiian's widebody jets, pilots and international networks, opening a runway for growth in long-haul international markets.
In an interview, Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said it was the right time to do the deal, which he described as "a great investment, a great step change" for the company.
Alaska told analysts on Sunday that pursuing long-haul international flying on its own would be much more expensive and much more difficult.
Courtney Miller, a consultant who advocated for the merger between the two airlines back in 2019, said Alaska would probably have to invest around the same amount it is paying for Hawaiian to launch its own smaller international operation.
Getting into long-haul international flying by using Hawaiian's fleet of wide-body jets and international networks is a better option, he said.
With both Boeing BA.N and Airbus AIR.PA facing supply-chain problems, the deal allows Alaska to avoid a prolonged wait for new planes. It also reduces the need to hire and train pilots during an industry-wide staffing crunch and saves the company from fighting for slots at international airports.
"The risk is much lower," said Miller, who now runs consultancy firm Visual Approach Analytics.
Mergers and acquisitions create economies of scale that helps offset soaring operating costs. Alaska, however, will be challenged on this front as it integrates Hawaiian's fleet, said Schonland.
While the Seattle-based airline flies Boeing's 737 planes, Hawaiian's fleet has a number of Airbus jets, so a combined company would have to rely on different parts and mechanics for repairs. Minicucci said while the combined company will continue to operate a mixed fleet for now, he did not rule out reviewing the plane mix.
Legacy airlines like Delta DAL.N and United UAL.O have been able to mitigate inflationary pressures due to strong bookings for flights to Europe and Asia. But softening domestic travel demand has hurt earnings of domestic carriers including Alaska.
Similar growth concerns prompted JetBlue to launch a hostile bid for Spirit last year to try to expand JetBlue's domestic footprint and help it capitalize on the surge in leisure travel between the U.S. East Coast and the Caribbean.
The deals, however, face challenges in convincing anti-trust regulators that they are pro-competition and pro-consumer.
Former Federal Trade Commission Chairman William Kovacic, who now teaches at George Washington University law school, said the DOJ is likely to look at Alaska's transaction carefully.
"They approach airlines with a view that merger policy has been too permissive and allowed excessive concentration," he said.

Dec 8 (Reuters) - South Africa's Kumba Iron Ore KIOJ.J, a unit of global mining giant Anglo American Plc AAL.L, on Friday said it was cutting production over the next three years to align output to constrained capacity to transport minerals via rail to port.
Transnet, South Africa's state-owned freight rail and port operator, is struggling to haul minerals and other commodities to export markets due to locomotive shortages, cable theft and vandalism of its infrastructure. This has cost exporters billions of rand in potential revenue.
Kumba, whose iron ore stockpiles had grown to 9 million tons by September due to the rail bottlenecks, said it expects to end 2023 with production of between 35-36 million tons, from the previous forecast between 35–37 million tons.
Kumba has also lowered its production outlook for the next three years to 35–37 million tons per year, from previous targets of 37–39 million tons in 2024 and 39–41 million
tons in 2025, it said in a production update.
"There is no escaping the fact that ongoing logistics constraints have continued to place significant pressure on our value chain, resulting in stock levels at the mines increasing to unsustainable levels. We have therefore slowed down production," Kumba CEO Mpumi Zikhalala said.
The persistent logistics problems have resulted in a 15% decrease in iron ore railed to port since 2019, Kumba said.
Anglo American CEO Duncan Wanblad told an investor call on Friday that the group had decided to slow down production at Kumba and move stockpiles until Transnet's logistics problems were resolved.
"As soon as we get the transport capacity, we would be able to ramp the production back up," Wanblad said.
The global mining giant was preparing to freeze spending on growth and widen job cuts in South Africa, including mothballing some higher-cost platinum mines, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
At Kumba, the restructuring had already seen a 30% reduction in head office staff in September, Zikhalala said during an investor call. The company was also reviewing its use of contractors, she added.
On Friday, Anglo American said it aims to cut capital expenditure by $1.8 billion by 2026, as it grapples with a fall in demand for most of the metals it mines and a huge writedown for its British fertiliser project.
Kumba is targeting up to 3 billion rand ($159 million) in 2023 cost savings, having reduced its capital expenditure the year by about $105 million to between $475 million and $530 million earlier in the year.

Futures up: Dow 0.06%, S&amp;P 0.07%, Nasdaq 0.03%
Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Tuesday, building on strong gains in recent weeks as investors continued to bet on a policy pivot by the Federal Reserve next year.
The benchmark S&amp;P 500 .SPX trades just 1.2% shy of its all-time closing high as traders price in an aggressive timetable for interest rate cuts next year after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week the historic tightening of monetary policy is likely over.
Despite attempts by policymakers to temper the optimism since, traders have priced in a 67% chance of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points in March, as per the CMEGroup's FedWatch tool, and cuts of 143 bps by December 2024. FEDWATCH
The S&amp;P 500 marked a seventh straight week of gains on Friday, its longest winning streak since 2017, while the blue-chip Dow .DJI is trading near all-time highs.
Housing starts number for November is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Investors are awaiting a slew of economic data this week, with focus on the final reading of third-quarter GDP on Thursday, followed by monthly personal consumption expenditure index (PCE) on Friday, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Monday that cuts to the U.S. central bank's benchmark rate are likely be appropriate next year because of an improvement in inflation this year, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Fed Atlanta President Raphael Bostic and Fed Chicago President Austan Goolsbee are scheduled to speak later in the day. Daly and Bostic are voting members in the FOMC's rate-setting committee next year.
At 5:36 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 21 points, or 0.06%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 3.25 points, or 0.07%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 4.5 points, or 0.03%.
Apple shares AAPL.O were flat in premarket trading after the company said it would pause sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States from this week, as it deals with a patent dispute over the technology that enables the blood oxygen feature on the devices.
PepsiCo PEP.O slipped 0.6% after J.P. Morgan downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight".
Plug Power PLUG.O fell 3.4% after Piper Sandler downgraded the hydrogen fuel cell firm to "underweight".

    <nas:hasContent>Gold delivered a moderate performance this year. Gold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Shares GLD added more than 9.8% this year (as of Dec 4, 2023). However, after wild swings, gold showed a strong rebound lately and hit an all-time high.
Gold prices tend to move inversely to interest rates. When interest rates decline, non-interest-bearing gold becomes more attractive as it competes more favorably with interest-bearing investments like bonds. A less-hawkish Fed in the past few months have led to the gains in the currency.
Additionally, the demand for inflation hedge and growing fears regrading global growth worries are driving investors toward gold, as it is considered a safe haven. Gold demand in India, the world's second-largest consumer of the yellow metal, increased 10% during the third quarter of 2023, helped by a slight softening of gold prices and festive demand, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Meanwhile, gold demand in China, the world's largest gold-consuming nation, rose marginally in Q3 this year.
Let’s delve a little deeper.
“Gold In Early Days of a Bull Market”?
"I think gold is in the early days of a bull market breaking out to new highs," Mike McGlone, Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist, told Yahoo Finance.
And why not?
There is almost no chance of a Fed rate hike this year. There is 84.8% chance of rates being the same in January and about 41.8% chance of rates remaining the same in March 2024, per CME FedWatch Tool. A decline in inflation has boosted the probability of a less-hawkish Fed. This would likely weaken the U.S. dollar and favor gold prices. Talks are rife that The Fed may even cut rates in latter part of 2024.
The month of December is especially upbeat for gold. Normally, there is a rise in jewelry demand which helps gold produce positive average returns of 0.71% and 1.3%, respectively, in November and December. Plus, a generally weaker dollar in December promotes gold in recording its average second-best month of the year, per an article on capex.com.
India – the world's second-largest consumer of the yellow metal -- play a key role in determining gold prices during November-December due to the occurrence of the Dhanteras festival (the most auspicious day in India for buying items precious metals) and wedding season.
Central Banks Buying
Central banks in emerging markets are seeking to lower reliance on the U.S. dollar for reserves holdings (especially in light of the United States using the dollar as a tool in its sanctions against Russia) and is also intending to hedge against inflation. In the first nine months of the year, China has taken the lead in driving unprecedented central bank acquisitions of gold worldwide, followed by Poland and Turkey, per Financial Times. The buying has been on top of last year’s all-time high.
Global official gold reserves are 120% higher quarter over quarter and boast the second-highest third quarter total since the industry group World Gold Council started publishing the quarterly metric, per yahoo Finance.
Bottom Line
The gold’s rally from here depends on the Fed’s behavior and the progression of geopolitical crisis. If the Fed stays put from here, it would be a good new for gold investing. Gold investors should closely watch the economic and market events before taking any decision.
Hence, investors should track the ETFs like iShares Gold Trust IAU, abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF SGOL, SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM and Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF AAAU closely. In a bull-case scenario, investors should track leveraged gold ETF ProShares Ultra Gold UGL.

    <nas:hasContent>By Rajendra Jadhav, Polina Devitt and Clara Denina
MUMBAI/LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - India, home to 90% of the world's diamond cutting and polishing industry, and De Beers, the top global rough diamonds producer by value, are seeking clarity and flexibility from G7 countries in implementing a ban on imports of Russian gems.
The Group of Seven countries on Wednesday announced a direct ban on Russian diamonds starting Jan. 1 followed by phased-in restrictions on indirect imports of Russian gems from around March 1. Russia is the world's biggest producer of rough diamonds by volume with a 30% share of the market.
The implementation will depend heavily on India, which wants to minimise potential disruptions for small diamond firms employing millions of people.
"We are not happy with the announced timeline for implementation of restrictions," said Vipul Shah, chairman of the Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), a leading Indian trade body.
"Recognising the diversity of our industry, we believe there should be more flexibility in these timelines," he said in a statement.
The G7's plan has sparked a debate inside the sector as it risks complicating supply chains when demand is under pressure. India's April-October polished diamond exports are down 29% to $10 billion.
"The G7 is essentially saying it is still a work in progress but here is a framework with a timeline," diamond analyst Paul Zimnisky said.
But "if Indian companies want to continue doing business with the G7 nations, then they are going to have to do their part," he added.
The G7 plans to introduce a traceability-based verification for rough diamonds by September, but for now two main questions of the plan remain unsolved: how a diamond's country of origin should be checked and where it should be done.
Belgium supports the idea of checks in Antwerp, the world's main diamond hub. Some in the industry are concerned that this would create supply chain bottlenecks, additional costs and hamper African production's access to the G7 markets.
"It is currently unclear what exactly will be involved at each stage, so we will seek further clarification before being able to consider impacts," De Beers, a unit of Anglo American AAL.L, said.
"If the intent is to apply a purely technological certification system and to channel all rough imports to the G7 through Belgium, this will be to the detriment of responsible African producers, to all those who depend on the artisanal mining sector, and to the wider industry," De Beers added.
Russian state-controlled diamond producer Alrosa ALRS.MM declined to comment.

    <nas:hasContent>Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new August 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.99/share today.
Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.60% return on the cash commitment, or 5.45% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $138.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.75% if the stock gets called away at the August 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $138.99) to be 27%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

    <nas:hasContent>CHICAGO, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Flight attendants at Southwest Airlines LUV.N have rejected a tentative contract agreement, with 64% of them voting against the proposed five-year deal, their union said on Friday.
The Transport Workers Union (TWU) Local 556, representing nearly 19,000 flight attendants, said in a statement "this proposed contract is not going to heal the hurt."
Southwest's flight attendants have been demanding higher pay and better work rules in the new contract. The previous contract came up for renewal in 2018.
Rivals American Airlines AAL.O and United Airlines UAL.O are also still negotiating with their flight attendants. Delta Air Lines' DAL.N flight attendants are not unionized.
The TWU Local 556 said on Friday, "we will go back to the table to achieve the collective bargaining agreement that meets the needs of the hardest-working flight attendants in the industry."
Southwest's proposed contract included a 20% pay raise beginning next month and a 3% annual raise in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028.
The union had said that would have resulted in a 36% increase over the life of the contract for flight attendants at top of scale and up to 90% for other seniorities.
The tentative agreement also provided for paid parental and maternity leave with insurance coverage.
In the past two years, unions across the aerospace, construction, airline and rail industries have put up fights for higher wages and more benefits in a tight labor market.
Southwest has yet to reach a contract deal with its pilots.

Dec 1 (Reuters) - European shares gained on Friday on a strong boost from miners, while investors awaited policy comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after cooler-than-expected inflation prints bolstered bets of interest rate cuts.
The pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX was up 0.7% at 0920 GMT, after logging its strongest monthly gain of 6.4% in November since the start of the year, also helped by a fall in eurozone bond yields.
It is now on course to log its third straight weekly gain, led by technology .SX8P and financial services shares .SXFP.
Miners .SXPP were the top sectoral gainers in early trading, rising 3.3% to a four-month high following higher metal prices on a softer dollar and supportive data from top consumer China.
Anglo American AAL.L topped the STOXX 600 with a 6.3% gain, while Antofagasta ANTO.L jumped 4.1% after UBS upgraded both the miners to "buy" from "neutral".
All eyes are now on comments from Fed's Powell later in the day for further clues on global policy outlook after data out of Europe and the United States on Thursday reflected a sustained drop in inflation.
"An overall weaker eurozone inflation print is some relief. Some point in the future investors are seeing some relief to eurozone via lower rates, and that pushes back against some of the stagflation fears that have been growing," said Giles Coghlan, chief market analyst at brokerage GCFX Ltd.
"I don't think we're out of the woods and the eurozone is very data dependent... this week is just in a little bit of relief in that narrative."
Goldman Sachs now expects the European Central Bank to deliver its first rate cut in the second quarter of 2024, compared to earlier forecast of third quarter of next year.
However, joining the choir of ECB officials snubbing rate cut bets, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel noted risks are skewed towards more negative outcomes, so a further rate hike cannot be dismissed and cuts should not even be discussed.
Meanwhile, fresh data showed the broad-based downturn in euro zone manufacturing activity eased slightly last month, but the sector remained deeply rooted in contractionary territory.
Other data sets showed Italy's economy grew 0.1% in the third quarter, thanks to exports and firm consumer spending, revising up preliminary data. The benchmark index .FTMIB was up 0.5%.
Among individual stocks, SignifyLIGHT.AS jumped 5.6% as the world's biggest lights maker announced a new organisation structure to reduce costs.
Bechtle AGBC8G.DE dropped 5.3% after announcing a convertible bond offering.
Struggling Swedish streaming company ViaplayVPLAYb.ST tanked 76% to a record low on plans to raise new equity and restructure its debt.

CHICAGO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Negotiators for pilots at Southwest Airlines LUV.N have reached an agreement in principle with the company for a new five-year contract worth $12 billion, the union said on Tuesday, adding that its board still needs to decide whether to send the deal to members for a ratification vote.
The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), which represents more than 10,000 pilots at the Dallas-based carrier, did not provide details of the deal. The union later said it was worth $12 billion over five years.
Casey Murray, SWAPA's president, said the union's board will meet on Wednesday to evaluate the deal and decide whether to send it to the pilots for a ratification vote.
Southwest and its pilots have been in negotiations for a new contract for more than three years and in federal mediation since September 2022. The last contract ended in 2020.
The pilots have been demanding higher pay and better work rules.
Union officials said the delay in getting a new contract has driven up attrition rates at the carrier, with hundreds of pilots leaving for rival airlines.
An industry-wide shortage of pilots has left U.S. airlines scrambling to hire and retain talent, bolstering pilots' bargaining power.
Pilots at United Airlines UAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and American Airlines AAL.O have all secured hefty pay raises and improvements in working conditions in new contracts.
Post-pandemic labor shortages and high inflation have emboldened workers and their unions to use strikes, strategic walkouts and pickets to extract concessions across auto, airline, entertainment and healthcare industries.

    <nas:hasContent>In the current investment landscape, the focus has shifted from the FANG stocks, and a new set of influential stocks, known as the Magnificent Seven Stocks, has emerged. These stocks include Alphabet GOOGL, Apple (AAPL), Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA. These companies are considered the new leaders in the stock market.
There is a pureplay ETF called Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS on this theme. The ETF has surged more than 30% this year. Individually, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are up more than 50% each, Meta shares are up about 165%, Amazon has gained 70%, Nvidia has skyrocketed about 233% and Tesla is up nearly 118% this year.
But there are three tech stocks — Vertiv VRT, IonQ IONQ and Applied Optoelectronics AAOI — that have beaten even the best of Magnificent Seven, i.e., Nvidia.
Inside the Dominance of Magnificent Seven
The Magnificent Seven stocks have a significant impact on the Nasdaq index, as they collectively account for a major portion of its total weighting. Despite recent fluctuations in the market, some of the Magnificent Seven Stocks, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, and Meta, continue to exert a substantial impact on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index mainly due to their meaningful positions in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) space. The AI boom made them stars in 2023.
What About Other Tech Jewels?
Even in the narrow market breadth, some tech companies shined. With the Fed expected to go slow on its rate hike spree in 2024 (or even cut rates in late 2024), overall tech space should do well as the area thrives better in a low-rate environment.
Already, market breadth has continued to broaden, and smaller tech companies are likely to excel. Plus, the AI boom is ongoing, which is expected to push the space to another height next year.
Stock to Watch
Below, we highlight those winning tech stocks that trumped even Magnificent Seven in 2023. Since these stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), these winners have more room for growth going into 2024.
Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) – Up 888.3% YTD
Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. designs, develops and manufactures advanced optical devices, packaged optical components, optical subsystems, laser transmitters and fiber optic transceivers. The Zacks Rank #3 company belongs to a top-ranked Zacks sector (top 31%).
IonQ IONQ– Up 268.8% YTD
IonQ Inc. provides a quantum system through the cloud on Amazon Braket, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, as well as through direct API access. IonQ Inc., formerly known as dMY Technology Group Inc. III., is based in COLLEGE PARK, Md. The Zacks Rank #2 company hails from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 36%) and sector (top 31%).
Vertiv VRT – Up 271.7% YTD
Vertiv Holdings Co provides digital infrastructure and continuity solutions. It offers hardware, software, analytics and ongoing services. The Zacks Rank #1 company belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 21%) and sector (top 31%).

    <nas:hasContent>If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/09/2010.
The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $368.80 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Blend
Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.
Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.43%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 7.53% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).
The top 10 holdings account for about 30.44% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
VOO seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index before fees and expenses. The S&amp;P 500 Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.
The ETF has added about 25.26% so far this year and it's up approximately 24.84% in the last one year (as of 12/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $346.17 and $435.54.
The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 17.49% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 507 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VOO is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track the same index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $397.71 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $456.74 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.
Bottom-Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

    <nas:hasContent>Higher fuel costs have posed a major challenge for airlines but the ongoing holiday season appears to be one of the best ones for airline operators. After witnessing robust traffic during the Thanksgiving weekend, airline companies are gearing up to handle even bigger traffic during the Christmas weekend.
Hence, investors should utilize this opportunity and invest in airline stocks like American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, Southwest Airlines LUV, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL.
Christmas Travel to Soar
According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the 2023 holiday season is projected to be the busiest period for domestic air travel in more than two decades or since it started tracking in 2000.
The Thanksgiving weekend already saw record domestic traffic and now the AAA projects 7.5 million passengers traveling through U.S. airports during the 10-day holiday season between Christmas and New Year, higher than the 7.3 million recorded in 2019.
The average cost of round-trip tickets has been recorded as "slightly lower" than previous years.
“This year-end holiday forecast, with an additional 2.5 million travelers compared to last year, mirrors what AAA Travel has been observing throughout 2023,” Paula Twidale, Senior Vice President of AAA Travel, said.
According to the AAA, the number of people opting for alternative modes of travel, such as trains or cruises, is expected to exceed 2019 levels. This marks a 2.2% increase from 2022 and stands as the second-highest number since the AAA began recording travel data in 2000.
Last year, inclement weather disrupted travel plans during this period, leading numerous airlines to cancel thousands of flights nationwide. However, this year, most airlines are better prepared to handle such situations more efficiently.
Airline companies were one of the biggest casualties of the pandemic that brought travel to a standstill. This saw all major U.S. airline companies incurring huge losses in 2020 and 2021.
The following year saw traffic picking up but 2023 has so far merged as a turnaround year for airlines.
The removal of pandemic-induced restrictions has led to a surge in pent-up demand for air travel. Despite significant challenges posed by increased fuel and labor costs in the airline industry, there is considerable optimism surrounding air travel this year.
Airlines are actively preparing to accommodate the heightened demand by adding more seats per day during the period. Additionally, enticing discounts are being offered as part of efforts to attract more passengers.
Stocks to Watch
Given this situation, it would be ideal to keep these four airline stocks on your radar.
American Airlines Group Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Envoy Aviation Group, PSA Airlines and Piedmont Airlines. AAL’s primary business is to provide passenger and cargo services.
American Airlines Group’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 378%. Shares of AAL have gained 16.3% in the past 30 days. American Airlines Grouppresently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Southwest Airlines’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 19.8%. Shares of LUV have gained 26.7% in the past 30 days. Southwest Airlines presently has a Zacks Rank #3.

    <nas:hasContent>What was the top financial story of 2023? It has to be Artificial Intelligence (AI), right?
No other subject dominated the headlines quite like AI. Whether it was ChatGPT, viral AI-generated images, or the failed ouster of Sam Altman at OpenAI, it seems AI keeps pumping out big stories, one after the other.
So, with 2024 right around the corner, here are three AI stocks worth owning in 2024 -- and beyond.
Image source: Getty Images.
AI analysis can help companies optimize their operations
Jake Lerch (Palantir Technologies): With the stock up 178% year to date, 2023 has been an incredible year for Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and its shareholders. There are, however, signs that 2024 (and beyond) could be even better.
Palantir operates AI-based analytics systems for governmental and commercial uses and is on the leading edge of translating AI innovation into shareholder returns. Consider Palantir's recent announcement that it is extending its long-standing partnership with UniCredit S.p.A., a major European bank.
In its press release , Palantir noted that its signature Foundry operating system delivered material results for UniCredit. For example, in 2023, "advanced analytics and propensity models in Foundry helped [UniCredit] generate a four-fold increase in customer redemption of protection products through better targeting."
Indeed, UniCredit is just one of many customers that is desperate to ramp up its use of AI to streamline its operations. In a Dec. 7, 2023 interview with Fox Business, Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp said, "We just can't keep up with our product demand...We are just breaking at the seams in the U.S."
The numbers certainly back that statement up. In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Sept. 30, 2023), Palantir grew revenue by 17% year over year. Trailing-12-month revenue hit $2.1 billion, gross profit swelled to $1.7 billion, and free cash flow increased to $474 million.

Nevertheless, Palantir stock isn't for everyone. Since the company is still early in its lifecycle, its stock will be volatile. Indeed, shares plummeted more than 84% from their all-time high between January 2021 and January 2023.
Still, for long-term, growth-oriented investors, Palantir is a name worth considering, given the soaring demand for its products and its improving fundamentals.
AI isn't just about what you see; it's about what you say and hear
Justin Pope (SoundHound AI): Much of the hype around AI has focused on large language models like ChatGPT, but there are other ways to use AI that investors may not be fully aware of. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) develops conversational AI, taking an audio input, such as someone voicing a question and responding with dialogue or action.
Conversational AI has a lot of existing and potential use cases. SoundHound AI is used in restaurant and hospitality industries to take orders or make reservations. It's in vehicles, smart devices, and appliances for voice assistance. In the future, the technology could find its way into healthcare, customer service, and more. SoundHound AI estimates a long-term potential addressable market of $160 billion.
As a company, SoundHound AI is just getting started. It's only done $38 million in revenue over the past 12 months, but analysts believe it will grow significantly. Estimates call for 50% revenue growth over the next two years. The company also recently announced an acquisition of SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions, giving SoundHound access to a potential restaurant pipeline of 100,000 locations.
SoundHound AI is a risky stock because the business is so nascent. It's burning cash every quarter, and there is only a year or so of cash on the balance sheet at this rate. Investors shouldn't be shocked if the company issues new stock to raise funds. Conversely, the stock's market cap is just $480 million. Investors could eventually be handsomely rewarded if SoundHound AI can become a leader in this massive (but underrated) niche within AI.
It's way too early to count out this "AI-first" company
Will Healy (Alphabet): The narrative in the AI space seems to have turned away from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).
Indeed, the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT seemed to catch Alphabet off guard, particularly as rival Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) forged an alliance with the research and development company. This gave users a reason to start using Microsoft's search engine, Bing, and some began questioning the dominance of the Google search engine for the first time in several years.
However, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI tool called Bard. While the tools offer similar results, Bard was first in producing more up-to-date results as it leverages Google's search engine.
Moreover, the company has a long history with AI. Alphabet first used AI to correct spelling as early as 2001. The tools advanced from that point, so much so that Alphabet declared itself an "AI first" company in 2016.
Furthermore, investors should remember that Alphabet owns numerous companies, some of which could drive AI innovation. Earlier this year, it combined two of its AI companies into Google DeepMind. This subsidiary is a group of scientists, engineers, and others researching AI.
Also, with the funding backing Google DeepMind, the company has a high probability of driving innovation. Alphabet claims almost $120 billion in liquidity, and it generated nearly $32 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of 2023. This gives the company tremendous resources to develop AI-related products and the ability to purchase the innovation it cannot create.
Such optionality gives investors fewer reasons to doubt Alphabet, and one has to wonder whether the sentiment against the Google parent was overblown. Despite the concerns of some, the stock has risen by more than 40% over the last 12 months.
GOOGL PE Ratio data by YCharts
Additionally, the increase has taken its P/E ratio to 26. While not inexpensive, its P/E is lower than those of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Microsoft. That lower valuation could be an opportunity to buy this stock as it uses its AI knowledge base and vast resources to remain a force in the artificial intelligence industry.
Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

    <nas:hasLsaSummary>By Stephanie Kelly, Jarrett Renshaw and Leah Douglas NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected this week to recognize a soon-to-be-updated methodology favored by the ethanol industry in guidance to companies looking to claim tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. As it stands, that model would enable ethanol-based SAF to qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law. One of environmental groups' central concerns about the use of the GREET model - that it would underestimate the emissions generated by tilling land for crops - appears to be unresolved, said Nikita Pavlenko, fuels team lead at the International Council on Clean Transportation.</nas:hasLsaSummary>
    <nas:hasLuhnSummary>By Stephanie Kelly, Jarrett Renshaw and Leah Douglas NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is expected this week to recognize a soon-to-be-updated methodology favored by the ethanol industry in guidance to companies looking to claim tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. For months the administration has been divided over whether to recognize the Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model.

The lifecycle emissions calculated by GREET for any given fuel can vary widely depending on what data sources and assumptions are plugged into the model, and any future update on how producers should use the GREET model needs to take a stringent approach, he said.</nas:hasTextrankSummary>

LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Mine closures and disruptions have rapidly changed the landscape for copper supplies and prompted analysts to lower their forecasts for surpluses in a positive signal for prices of the industrial metal.
Copper prices CMCN3 on the London Metal Exchange on Friday headed towards the four-month highs of $8,640 a metric ton seen on December 1, partly due to Anglo American AAL.L lowering its production guidance.
The London-listed miner said output next year would amount to 730,000-790,000 metric tons, down 20% from a previous estimate, while for 2025 it expects to produce 690,000 to 750,000 tons, down 18% from its previous estimate.
Anglo is putting one of the processing plants at its Los Bronces operation in Chile on care and maintenance and plans for its Quellaveco facility in Peru have "been adjusted" to safely navigate a geotechnical fault line.
"(Anglo's) newly issued guidance for 2026 was also well below our numbers," said Macquarie analyst Alice Fox.
"Vale announced new guidance this week that was below our expectations as well, but not to the same scale ...the outlook for prices is more bullish if demand holds up."
Brazil's Vale VALE3.SAestimated its copper production at 320,000 to 355,000 tons in 2024 versus 325,000 tons this year.
Macquarie now expects copper market surpluses of 100,000 and 287,000 tons for 2024 and 2025 respectively, down from previous forecasts of 203,000 and 369,000 tons.
Global copper production next year and in 2025 is expected to be around 27 million tons.
Disruptions at First Quantum's FM.TO Cobre mine in Panama, accounting for 1% of global mined supply last year, are also on the watchlist. Its future is uncertain due to the country's top court declaring as unconstitutional First Quantum's contract to own and operate the mine.
Even before Anglo's announcement, Bank of America analyst Michael Widmer had removed Cobre Panama from his estimate of copper supplies for next year and switched his forecast from a small surplus to a deficit.
"To us, a restart looks unlikely before the May 2024 general elections in Panama at the earliest, i.e. once a new administration is established with which First Quantum may begin negotiating a contract," Widmer said.
"While elections could bring change, we now assume a potential restart of Cobre Panama in the fourth quarter of next year."
